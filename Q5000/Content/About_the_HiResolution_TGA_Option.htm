        </h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">TGA is particularly useful for observing the thermal decomposition of compounds. When individual thermal decompositions occur at well separated temperatures, quantitative information about sample composition can be obtained from the percent weight change at each transition. However, many TGA decomposition transitions overlap or appear drawn out in temperature due to the time-dependent nature of the reactions taking place. This overlap substantially reduces the ability to obtain an accurate measurement of weight change and reaction temperature.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">It has long been known that using very slow heating rates will improve the separation of some overlapping transitions and, thus, increase the resolution of the TGA scan. Another technique to increase resolution is to increase furnace temperature until the onset of decomposition and then hold temperature isothermally until the decomposition is complete. After which, the temperature is raised again until the next decomposition begins, and so on until the final temperature of interest is reached. A third technique to increase resolution is controlling the furnace temperature in such a way as to maintain a preselected constant reaction rate (%/minute). This results in slower or even negative heating rates during a transition which gives the reaction more time to reach completion before the next transition is encountered.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">The major drawback to these techniques is that they increase substantially the total time required for a measurement, thereby reducing laboratory productivity. Moreover, increasing measurement time often reduces the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. This is due to exposing the sample to high temperatures for long periods of time which may cause slow time-dependent changes such as oxidation and absorption, or exposure to changing ambient conditions such as humidity and pressure.

        </h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">The TA Instruments Hi-Res technique, dynamic rate TGA, differs from previous control techniques in that the heating rate of the sample material is dynamically and continuously modified in response to changes in the rate of decomposition of the sample so as to optimize both weight change resolution and time of analysis. This TGA technique (supplied with the Q5000 IR) allows the use of very high &#160;heating rates during ramp segments where no weight changes are occurring, but automatically slows the heating rate during weight changes. Once the weight change(s) are complete, the system returns to the selected ramp heating rate. &#160;Typical Hi-Res ramps often take the same or less time to complete than a comparable constant heating rate experiment run at a lower heating rate, while providing improved resolution.

        </h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">The Hi-Res TGA option consists of not one, but several techniques, which all have the common characteristic of controlling the thermal experiment based on changes in the sample weight. Both absolute weight change and the rate of weight change can be utilized. These capabilities add a whole new dimension to TGA experiments.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">Some general guidelines have already been presented in the previous sections on how to set some of the parameters involved in using Hi-Res TGA. In the next section we consider more closely why one technique may give better results than another, and present additional guidelines for selecting techniques and setting parameters.</p>

        </h4>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">It has long been known that using very slow heating rates will improve the separation of some overlapping transitions and, thus, increase the resolution of the TGA scan. This is the situation when using the Dynamic Rate experiments.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">In dynamic rate Hi-Res mode, one or more Hi-Res ramp segments are used with positive resolution settings. In this mode, the furnace heating rate is varied between a fixed minimum and the maximum specified in the ramp segment, but is never reduced to zero (isothermal). A mathematical function is used to relate the rate of weight change (%/minute) to the sample heating rate (°C/minute). Dependant variables to this function are resolution setting, sensitivity setting and maximum heating rate. Independent variables are both short and long-term rates of weight-change (%/minute), time and temperature. The result is the ability to directly compute the appropriate heating rate for the current weight change conditions.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">Because the dynamic rate Hi-Res mode reduces heating rate smoothly and only when necessary, it is the fastest and most reliable of the various techniques. This mode gives good results with most temperature separable transitions. It is preferred for fast survey scans of unknown materials over wide temperature ranges. If no other criteria exists to select a Hi-Res technique, then dynamic rate is the preferred choice.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">Another technique to increase resolution is raising furnace temperature until the onset of decomposition and then holding temperature isothermally until the decomposition is complete. After which, the temperature is raised again until the next decomposition begins, and so on until the final temperature of interest is reached.</p>

        </h4>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">In constant reaction rate Hi-Res mode, one or more Hi-Res ramp segments are used with negative resolution settings. In this mode the heater control system varies the temperature of the furnace as required to maintain a constant preselected rate of weight change (%/minute). Whenever the rate of weight change exceeds the percent/minute threshold, the heating rate of the furnace is reduced, even to the point of cooling if necessary. When percent/minute falls below the threshold the heating rate is increased up to the maximum specified for the ramp segment. Transition resolution is improved because sample heating is reduced or reversed during transitions allowing them to complete at the selected reaction rate before moving on to the next transition.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">When used with semi-pressurized sample containment, constant reaction rate mode becomes even more powerful. The vapor pressure which builds up inside the sample container limits the rate of reaction of the sample. This allows the reaction to complete at a nearly constant rate and temperature. The reaction progresses more uniformly throughout the sample because vapor pressure gradients in and around the sample material are substantially reduced. The onset of higher temperature reactions is effectively suppressed until the completion of lower temperature reactions.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">Constant reaction rate mode is preferred for any sample where it is important to limit or control the rate of reaction. These may include pyrotechnics, self-heating reactions, auto-catalyzing reactions and gas diffusion reactions. Constant reaction rate mode is also a good choice when it is important to accurately determine the transition temperature at a given reaction rate.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">Another area where constant reaction rate heating can be helpful, is when the sample material exhibits a relatively large and somewhat constant background weight change, onto which is superimposed a relatively small transition. If the decomposition rate threshold is chosen to be close to the background percent/minute at the maximum heating rate, then the heating rate will only be changed significantly when the smaller transition occurs.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">Derivative of weight change curves that are plotted versus temperature may appear cyclic and have negative peaks as well as positive ones. This effect is caused by the automatic application of cooling whenever the rate of weight change (%/minute) exceeds the specified set point. In many cases the appearance of the derivative curve can be improved by increasing the derivative smoothing window in the data analysis program.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">Constant reaction rate mode works best at lower heating rates (1 to 10°C/minute), where significant reaction rate and transition temperature overshoot can be avoided. Usually several scans of the same material are required to determine the best reaction rate threshold to use. If the sample material is very reactive, or it is important not to overshoot the selected reaction rate, then even lower maximum heating rates may be required. This is particularly true for very small reaction rates (less than 0.1 %/minute)</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">Since the heater control system concentrates on a very narrow band of reaction rates, transitions with slightly different reaction rates in the same scan are often given very different treatment. For example, a transition which falls short of the %/minute threshold may be passed at a fairly high heating rate, with results similar to conventional constant heating rate TGA.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;font-size: 10pt;">Whereas, a transition which just crosses the %/minute threshold may cause a significant reduction in heating rate or even reversal of the heating process. The two transitions, although similar in nature, may appear quite different on a plot of weight change versus sample temperature. This effect is most noticeable at low sensitivity settings. The effect can be reduced or eliminated by using multiple ramp segments in the method, each tailored to the needs of specific transitions. Increasing sensitivity setting may also be helpful.</p>

        </h4>
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is important to note that, while most TGA work involves decomposition analysis, some applications involve weight gain such as in oxidation studies. The Hi-Res heating control techniques apply equally well to weight gains as to weight losses. In this case, the absolute value of the weight change signal is used for control. Weight gains of up to 200% can be accommodated. The rates of weight gain (%/minute) and their relationship to heating rate, resolution setting and sensitivity setting are exactly the same as for weight loss. No special parameters or controls are needed for Hi-Res weight gain analysis. Combinations of weight gain and weight loss in the same TGA scan are handled automatically. It is important to recognize, however, that when weight gain and weight loss transitions overlap, the resultant weight change is additive and may not be separable.</span>
