        <h4><a name="kanchor426"></a>Cell temperature will not equilibrate. Run terminated. </h4>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Problem: </p>
        <p>The run has stopped and data has been saved. The cell could not reach 
 the desired temperature within 90 minutes from the start of an Initial, 
 Equilibrate, or Increment segment. Either the cell temperature is more 
 than 4.0°C from the set point or the cell temperature is changing by more 
 than 0.50°C/min. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Solution: </p>
        <p>Try one or more of the following operations to solve the problem, then 
 restart your experiment. </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet" value="1">If the cell could not get 
 hot enough, check that the cell lids are in place and that the heater 
 is not burned out. Note that ambient temperature may be affecting the 
 cell. </li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="2">If the cell could not get 
 cold enough, check that the LNCS has an adequate supply of liquid nitrogen 
 and that the LNCS lines are not blocked. </li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="3">If the cell could not get 
 cold enough, make sure that you have not exceeded the limits of the cooling 
 device. </li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="4">If the cell temperature is 
 too low and a cooling device is in use, the cooling device may be overpowering 
 the heater. Try using less coolant or removing or turning off the cooling 
 device. </li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="5">If the cell temperature is 
 too high and a cooling device is not in use, consider installing a cooling 
 accessory or using air cool. A cooling accessory is always required for 
 equilibration below ambient temperature. </li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="6">If there is temperature oscillation 
 around the setpoint, make sure that ambient temperature changes are not 
 affecting the cell (<i>i.e</i>., install all cell lids). Check cooling 
 devices for proper operation. </li>
        </ul>
