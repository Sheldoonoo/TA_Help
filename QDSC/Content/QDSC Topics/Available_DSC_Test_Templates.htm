        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="Setting_Up_a_DSC_Ramp_Procedure.htm">DSC 
 Ramp experiments</a> heat or cool the material at a constant rate. &#160;The 
 results obtained are affected by the previous thermal history (often imparted 
 on the material during processing [e.g., extrusion]). &#160;Therefore, 
 the results are designated "as received.”</li>
            <li value="2"><a href="Setting_Up_a_DSC_Heat_Cool_Heat_Procedure.htm">DSC 
 Heat/Cool/Heat experiments</a> are designed to erase previous thermal 
 history by heating the material above a transition (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., 
 glass transition or melting), where relaxation or molecular rearrangement 
 can occur, then cooling at a known rate before heating again. &#160;The 
 first heating curve provides the “as received” information. The cooling 
 imparts a known thermal history. &#160;Therefore, 
 any differences observed between similar materials in the second heating 
 curve are related to real internal differences in the materials (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., molecular weight) rather than 
 previous thermal history effects.</li>
            <li value="3"><a href="Setting_Up_a_DSC_Cyclic_Procedure.htm">DSC 
 Cyclic experiments</a> are used to assess changes in the material as it 
 is exposed to a series of heating/cooling cycles. &#160;Multiphase 
 materials (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., emulsifiers) 
 often change internally (become less stable) during thermal cycling.</li>
            <li value="4"><a href="Setting_Up_a_DSC_Isothermal_Procedure.htm">DSC 
 Isothermal experiments</a> provide an indication of a material's stability 
 at elevated temperature. &#160;The

 offset and slope have drifted from zero. &#160;It

        <h3><a name="Modulated DSC Experiments"></a>Modulated DSC® 
 Experiments</h3>
        <p>In MDSC a complex heating profile (temperature regime) is applied to 
 the sample. &#160;Specifically, 
 a sinusoidal modulation (oscillation) is overlaid on the conventional 
 linear heating or cooling ramp to yield a profile in which the average 
 sample temperature continuously changes with time but not in a linear 
 fashion. &#160;The 
 net effect of imposing this more complex heating profile on the sample 
 is the same as if two experiments were run simultaneously on the material—one 
 experiment at the traditional linear (average) heating rate and one at 
 a sinusoidal (instantaneous) heating rate. &#160;The 
 general equation that describes the resultant heat flow at any point in 
 a DSC or MDSC experiment is:</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 10pt;" align="center">dQ/dt 
 = Cp<span style="font-family: Symbol, serif;">b</span> 
 + f(T,t)</p>
        <p>where: </p>
        <p>&#160;dQ/dt 
 = total heat flow</p>
        <p>Cp = heat 
 capacity</p>
        <p><span style="font-family: Symbol, serif;">b</span> &#160;&#160;= 
 heating rate</p>
        <p>f(T,t) 
 = heat flow from kinetic (absolute temperature and time-dependent) processes</p>
        <p>As can be seen from the equation, the total heat flow (dQ/dt), 
 which is the only heat flow measured by conventional DSC, is composed 
 of two components. &#160;One 
 component is a function of the sample's heat capacity and rate of temperature 
 change, and the other is a function of absolute temperature and time. 
 &#160;These components 
 are generally referred to as the "reversing" and "nonreversing" 
 heat flows respectively.</p>
        <p>The actual complex temperature/time profile in MDSC depends on three 
 variables—underlying heating/cooling rate, modulation period, and modulation 
 temperature amplitude. You will need to select the type of MDSC experiment 
 to perform as seen in the list below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="Setting_Up_a_Conventional_MDSC_Procedure.htm">Conventional 
 MDSC:</a> &#160;In 
 conventional MDSC experiments, all three variables are operator-selected 
 for best results and the material is evaluated during heating over a temperature 
 range. &#160;</li>
            <li value="2"><a href="Setting_Up_an_MDSC_Heat_Iso_Procedure.htm">MDSC 
 Heat Only:</a> &#160;Only 
 two variables are operator-selectable in heat only MDSC experiments. &#160;Those 
 are modulation period and heating rate. &#160;The 
 instrument automatically determines the modulation temperature amplitude 
 to ensure that the instantaneous heating rate never goes below zero.</li>
            <li value="3"><a href="Setting_Up_an_MDSC_Quasi-Isothermal_Procedure.htm">MDSC 
 Quasi-Isothermal:</a> In quasi-isothermal MDSC experiments the underlying 
 heating rate is zero. &#160;However, 
 by selecting a modulation temperature amplitude and period, the material 
 is still exposed to an instantaneous heating rate. This provides the ability 
 to obtain heat capacity information while the material is isothermal.</li>

        <h3><a name="Calibration_DSC_Experiments"></a>Calibration DSC Experiments</h3>
        <p>Calibration of the DSC instrument can be accomplished either by using 
 the Calibration Wizard or manually using the available templates listed 
 below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><a href="Calibrating_the_T1_Baseline.htm">Baseline 
 (T1 Heat Flow)</a>: &#160;The 
 baseline slope and offset calibration involves heating an empty cell through 
 the entire temperature range expected in subsequent experiments. &#160;The 
 calibration program is used to calculate the slope and offset values needed 
 to flatten the baseline and zero the heat flow signal. &#160;This 
 calibration is used in the Q10 and when the selected heat flow is T1 for 
 the DSC Q100 or Q1000.</li>
            <li value="2"><a href="Calibrating_Tzero.htm">Tzero 
 Heat Only Cal &#160;and 
 Tzero Heat/Cool Cal</a>: The DSC Tzero* calibration involves two experiments. 
 The first experiment is done without samples or pans (baseline); the second 
 is performed with large (approximately 95 mg) sapphire disks (without 
 pans) on both the sample and reference positions. Both experiments use 
 the same method. The range of temperatures should be at least as broad 
 as the desired experimental range. Tzero calibration should be done at 
 relatively high heating rates such as 20°C/min in order to obtain the 
 most accurate calibration of the sensor thermal capacitance and resistance 
 values. &#160;The 
 calibration program is used to analyze the data. &#160;Tzero 
 calibration is only used with the DSC Q100 and Q1000 for Heat Flow T4 
 and T4P. "Heat only calibration" is used when you are interested 
 measuring transitions or heat capacity while heating the sample. The "Heat 
 and Cool calibration" is used when you are interested in both heating 
 and cooling data when measuring transitions or heat capacity (this option 
 takes longer to calibrate). </li>
            <li value="3">Cell 
 Constant: This calibration is based on a run in which a standard metal 
 (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., indium) is heated through 
 its melting transition. The calculated heat of fusion is compared to the 
 theoretical value using the calibration program. The cell constant is 
 the ratio between these two values. The onset slope, or thermal resistance, 
 is a measure of the suppression of temperature rise that occurs in a melting 
 sample in relation to the thermocouple.</li>
            <li value="4">Temperature: 
 Temperature calibration is based on a run in which a temperature standard 
 (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., indium) is heated through 
 its melting transition using the same conditions to be used in subsequent 
 experiments (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., heating rate 
 and purge gas). &#160;The 
 recorded melting point of this standard is compared to the known melting 
 point and the difference is calculated for temperature calibration. The 
 calibration program is used for this analysis. Up to five standards may 
 be used for temperature calibration.</li>
