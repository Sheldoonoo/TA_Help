        <p>In a <a href="Setting_Up_a_Creep_Experiment.htm">Creep test</a>, a constant force (stress) is applied to the sample and the resulting displacement (strain) is measured as a function of time.</p>
        <p>The creep compliance [J(t)] is calculated by dividing the time-dependent strain <span style="font-family: Symbol, serif;">g</span>(t) by the applied stress <span style="font-family: Symbol, serif;">t</span>. &#160;Once the creep compliance has reached a steady state, the sample recovery can be measured by instantaneously removing the stress (stress = 0), and monitoring the recovered strain as a function of time.</p>
        <p>The recoverable compliance can be calculated by dividing the time-dependent recoverable strain <span style="font-family: Symbol, serif;">g</span><span style="vertical-align: Sub;">r</span>(t) by the stress applied in the creep zone. &#160;The recoverable compliance will eventually stabilize to a constant value. &#160;If the response is linear, the stabilized value of compliance is referred to as the equilibrium recoverable compliance, J<span style="vertical-align: Sub;">e</span><span style="vertical-align: Super;">o</span>.</p>
        <p>Viscoelastic behavior in creep can be represented by the Voigt model. &#160;This model consists of a spring and a dashpot combined in parallel. &#160;Upon the application of stress, the dashpot acts to exponentially retard the growth of strain with time. &#160;When the stress is removed, the dashpot again exponentially retards the recovery of strain. &#160;The time constant (<span style="font-family: Symbol, serif;">l</span>) is known as the retardation time and represents the characteristic time dependence of the system.</p>
        <p>In a <a href="Setting_Up_a_Stress_Relaxation_Experiment.htm">Stress Relaxation test</a>, a strain is instantaneously applied to the sample, and the stress required to maintain that strain is measured as a function of time. &#160;The stress relaxation modulus [G(t) using shear sandwich clamps or E(t) using tension, compression, or bending clamps] is calculated as the time-dependent stress divided by the constant strain. &#160;The sample recovery can also be monitored with time upon release of the strain.</p>
        <p class="Notes">NOTE: &#160;A negative strain value must be entered when the compression clamp is used in the stress relaxation mode.</p>
        <p>Viscoelastic behavior in stress relaxation can be represented by the Maxwell model. &#160;This model consists of a spring and a dashpot combined in series. &#160;Since the two elements are in series, when the strain is applied, a step change in strain results in deformation of the spring because the dashpot cannot respond instantaneously to the step change. &#160;Once the spring has responded, the stress of the system is at a maximum, but the gradual response of the dashpot is to extend itself, allowing the spring (and the stress) to relax.</p>
