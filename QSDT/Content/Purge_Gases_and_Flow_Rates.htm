        <h3><a name="SDT Purge Gases"></a>Choosing the SDT Purge Gases</h3>
        <h4>Primary Purge</h4>
        <p>You can control the sample atmosphere during SDT experiments by connecting a primary purge gas to the system. Purge gas is distributed separately to two parts of the SDT: the furnace and the balance chamber.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="1">
                <p class="Bullet">The primary purge enters the SDT through the Gas 1/Gas 2 ports on the rear of the instrument (see page 31 to connect the primary purge lines). &#160;The primary purge flows through the balance chamber and across the sample and reference measurement system before exiting out the end of the furnace tube. &#160;Because this purge flows through the balance chamber, the primary purge should be limited to common, preferably insert, gases such as nitrogen. &#160;Air can also be used as the primary purge. &#160;</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="2">
                <p class="Bullet">The primary purge is regulated by an internal mass flow controller (MFC) and a gas switching accessory. &#160;The MFC continuously monitors and controls the gas flow rate and allows the flow rate to be stored in the data files, if desired, and the gas switching accessory allows the primary purge gas to be changed in the middle of an experiment.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="1">
                <p class="Bullet">The primary (<span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">balance)</span> purge maintains a positive pressure in the balance housing to prevent decomposition products from contaminating the sensitive balance mechanism. The balance purge flows into the right side of the balance housing, directly through to the furnace, and exits via the exhaust nozzle on the left side of the furnace. The purge flows through the furnace horizontally across the sample, permitting rapid removal of decomposition products from the sample environment.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="2">
                <p class="Bullet" style="color: #000000;">Purge gas can be obtained from a pressurized cylinder or an in-house supply source. Gas supplied from an in-house source should be passed through a sieve dryer to remove any trace of moisture before it enters the SDT.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="3">
                <p class="Bullet">Oxidative stability experiments use nitrogen for the primary gas and oxygen for the secondary gas.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="4">
                <p class="Bullet">If you have an MFC, you can switch between the two gases (Gas #1 and Gas #2) by using a gas switch segment in your method. <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">See also:</span> &#160;<a href="#Switching%20gases%20in%20your%20experiment">Switching gases in your experiment</a>.</p>

        <h4>Secondary Purge</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="1">
                <p class="Bullet">The secondary purge provides additional experimental flexibility for introduction of a more reactive gas without exposing the sensitive balance assembly to that gas. &#160;The secondary purge enters the SDT through a special port located on the SDT housing (see page 32 to connect the secondary purge). &#160;This purge flows into the furnace area from a small diameter tube located between the reference and sample balance arms.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="2">
                <p class="Bullet">The flow rate of the secondary purge is usually lower than the primary purge (nominally 20 mL/min). &#160;Therefore, the primary purge prevents the secondary purge from back diffusing into the balance chamber, but rather sweeps the secondary purge across the sample and reference before exiting at the end of the furnace tube.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="3">
                <p class="Bullet">The secondary purge rate is controlled using an optional external flow meter and is not a stored signal. &#160;The secondary purge is not used in most SDT experiments.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="p-Bullet" value="1">
                <p class="Bullet">The secondary purge line is used to expose the sample to an additional gas, other than that used through the mass flow controller. &#160;This gas is introduced into the area of the sample and reference via a thin Inconel速 tube mounted between the balance arms. &#160;This secondary purge capability is designed to allow a second gas to be introduced in the vicinity of the sample without exposing the balance to that gas. To connect the secondary purge see "<a href="Connecting_Purge_Gas_Lines.htm#Secondary%20Purge%20Line">Connecting the Cooling Gas Line - Secondary Purge Line</a>."</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;The secondary purge is designed to allow introduction of a "reactive" gas at modest concentration in the area of the sample. &#160;The secondary purge line is made of stainless steel. The secondary purge tube in the furnace is Inconel速. Hence, only gases which do not react with stainless steel, Inconel速, or platinum (or the alumina furnace tube) should be used as a secondary purge gas.</p>

                <p class="Bullet"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Recommended Secondary Purge Gases:</span> &#160;<a href="#CAUTION">Oxygen**</a>, air, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, argon</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Notes">NOTE: &#160;If you are using laboratory (house) purge gas, rather than bottled purge gas, it is highly recommended that you install an external drier and a five-micron filter in the gas line prior to the instrument.</p>

        <p class="Cautions"><a name="CAUTION" id="CAUTION"></a>**CAUTION: &#160;Oxygen may be used as a secondary purge, however, the furnace tube must be kept clean of volatile hydrocarbons.</p>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;Do not use hydrogen or any other explosive gas in the SDT.</p>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;Do not use any liquid in the purge lines.</p>

        <p>The gas entries on the <a href="Experimental_View_PaneNotes_Page.htm">Notes Page</a> of the Experiment View are used to specify the primary gas and the associated flow rate for each run. If an MFC is installed, these settings will automatically set the gas and flow rate on a run by run basis. The scheduled run's purge settings will take effect immediately once the <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Apply</span> button is clicked. If your instrument does not have an MFC, then these entries are information only. To change the gas type, access <a href="Selecting_the_Instrument_Preferences.htm">Instrument Preferences</a>.</p>

        <h3><a name="Switching gases in your experiment"></a>Switching Gases in Your Experiment</h3>
        <p class="Bullet">Since your instrument is equipped with an MFC, you can set up your method so that the purge gas is switched during the procedure. This is done using the Gas Segment, which controls the switching of the gas between Gas 1 and 2. In addition, you can also change the flow rate within a method using the flow rate method segment.</p>
        <p class="Bullet">During an active experiment you can switch gases using the <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Control/Gas</span> menu or the <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">GAS</span> button on the instrument's <a href="Introducing_the_Touch_Screen.htm#Control%20Menu%20Touch%20Screen">Control touch screen</a>.</p>
