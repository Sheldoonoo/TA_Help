 instruments that function as either controlled-stress or controlled-rate 
 instruments. The rheometers are designed to fulfill the requirements of 
 measurement as implied by the full meaning of the term rheologyâ€”defined 
 as the "study of the deformation and flow of matter."</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor38"></a><a name="kanchor39"></a>Deformation is measured in the nondestructive region of elastic or viscoelastic 
 deformation. This can give invaluable information concerning the microscopic 
 interactions in the test material, as well as measuring the shear stress/shear 
 rate relationships at higher stresses. In the controlled-stress technique, 
 the stress can be applied and released at will, and the actual behavior 
 of the sample can be measured directly. This is not usually possible with 
 conventional controlled-shear rate instruments.</p>
        <p>In addition, most real-life situations can be simulated more accurately 
 using controlled-stress measurements.</p>
        <h3>Instrument Components</h3>
        <p class="Notes">NOTE: &#160;The 
 AR 2000 is described here. Refer to the operator's manual for information 
 specific to the type of Rheometer you are using.</p>
        <p>The instrument consists of a main unit mounted on a cast metal stand, 
 with the electronic control circuitry contained within a separate electronics 
 control box. </p>
        <p><a name="kanchor40"></a><a name="kanchor41"></a>The AR 2000 Rheometer contains an electronically-controlled induction 
 motor with an air bearing support for all the rotating parts. The drive 
 motor has a hollow spindle with a detachable draw rod inserted through 
 it. The draw rod has a screw-threaded section at the bottom, which allows 
 the geometry to be securely attached.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor42"></a><a name="kanchor43"></a><a name="kanchor44"></a><a name="kanchor45"></a>The measurement of angular displacement is done by an optical encoder 
 device. This can detect very small movements down to 40 nRad. The encoder 
 consists of a non-contacting light source and photocell arranged either 
 side of a transparent disc attached to the drive shaft. On the edge of 
 this disc are extremely fine, accurate photographically-etched radial 
 lines. Therefore, this is a diffraction grating. There is also a stationary 
 segment of a similar disc between the light source and encoder disc. The 
 interaction of these two discs results in diffraction patterns that are 
 detected by the photocell.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor46"></a><a name="kanchor47"></a>As the encoder disc moves when the sample strains under stress, these 
 patterns change. The associated circuitry interpolates and digitizes the 
 resulting signal to produce digital data. This data is directly related 
 to the angular deflection of the disc, and, therefore, the strain of the 
 sample.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor48"></a><a name="kanchor49"></a>The main electronics are housed in a separate control box. Temperature 
 control is achieved via interchangeable temperature options.</p>
