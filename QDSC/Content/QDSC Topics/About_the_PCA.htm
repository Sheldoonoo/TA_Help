        <p class="bullet">The Photocalorimeter Accessory (PCA) is used with the TA 
 Instruments DSC Q2000, Q200, Q1000 and Q100 Differential Scanning Calorimeters. 
 &#160;This accessory 
 allows samples placed inside the DSC cell to be irradiated with ultraviolet 
 or visible light. &#160;When 
 the samples (usually photopolymers) react to the light, heat is released 
 (i.e., an exothermic reaction occurs). &#160;This 
 heat is measured and used to study the relative reactivity and/or kinetics 
 of reaction. &#160;The 
 reactions studied are typically rapid and results are obtained in less 
 than 15 minutes.</p>
        <p class="bullet">The TA Instruments PCA accessory is based on a filter photometer, 
 which contains a high pressure mercury lamp that delivers light over the 
 spectral range 250 to 650 nanometers (nm). &#160;A 
 broadband filter (320 to 500 nm) is provided standard with the instrument. 
 &#160;Light is 
 transmitted from the instrument to the DSC cell via a one-meter long, 
 3-mm diameter, dual extended range (250 to 700 nm), quartz light guide. 
 &#160;The light 
 guide attaches to the cell itself using a special adapter. The figure 
 here shows those system components.</p>

        <h3><a name="Experiment Considerations"></a><a name="kanchor394"></a>Experiment Considerations</h3>
        <p>There are several fundamental instrument characteristics that affect 
 the quality of PCA results. &#160;Those 
 characteristics are: &#160;wavelength 
 range, light intensity at the DSC cell sample and reference positions, 
 baseline noise, exposure time, and temperature. The following paragraphs 
 describe aspects for each which should be considered when planning an 
 experiment using the PCA.</p>
        <p class="Notes">NOTE: &#160;The 
 patented Tzero<span style="vertical-align: Super;">TM</span> design of 
 the DSC cells provide important advantages when performing PCA experiments, 
 including the ability to directly measure and balance the light intensities 
 at the sample and reference platforms inside the cell and the ability 
 to perform dual sample experiments. These advantages are obtained only 
 when running in T4 or T4P heat flow mode. Therefore, it is required that 
 PCA experiments be run in T4 or T4P heat flow mode.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="#top" style="font-size: 8pt;">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Wavelength Range</h4>
        <p class="bullet">The PCA is a filter photometer instrument. A broadband 
 filter supplied with the instrument covers 320 to 500 nm and is suitable 
 for most UV and Visible PCA studies. Other optional filters include: 250 
 to 450 nm, 320 to 390 nm, 365 nm, and 400 to 500 nm. (Visible longpass 
 filters with cutoffs at 390 nm and 490 nm are also available as options. 
 These latter filters mount at the DSC end of the light guide.)</p>
        <p class="bullet" style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="#top" style="font-size: 8pt;">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Light Intensity</h4>
        <p class="bullet">The PCA is based on a high intensity, high pressure mercury 
 lamp capable of producing a total light intensity of about 25 W/cm<span style="vertical-align: Super;">2</span>. &#160;This 
 intensity is far in excess of that required for most photocalorimetry 
 experiments. &#160;(Most 
 experiments are performed with intensities between 20 to 100 mW/cm<span style="vertical-align: Super;">2</span> at the sample.) &#160;Therefore 
 the intensity reaching the DSC cell is adjusted using a combination of 
 aperture control at the PCA unit and neutral density and/or cutoff filters 
 at the end of the light guide.</p>
        <p class="bullet">The light intensities at the end of each "arm" 
 of the dual light guide must not only be regulated to the proper level, 
 they must also be balanced to produce minimum baseline offset. &#160;The 
 TA Instruments Q Series DSC's are based on a unique, patented design that 
 allows the heat flows at the sample and reference platforms in the DSC 
 cell to be independently measured. In the absence of a sample or reference 
 material and pans (i.e., an empty cell), the heat flows observed are directly 
 related to the light intensities at the platforms. &#160;Therefore 
 the actual intensity experienced by the sample can be determined. &#160;In 
 addition, the intensities at the sample and reference platforms can be 
 balanced by a simple adjustment on the cell light guide adapter.</p>
        <p class="bullet" style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="#top" style="font-size: 8pt;">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Baseline Noise</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Ideally, the light intensity delivered to the DSC cell 
 through the light guide should be constant. &#160;However, 
 the high pressure mercury lamp used in the PCA has some inherent fluctuations 
 in its output. &#160;The 
 DSC cell is sensitive enough to detect those small fluctuations in light 
 intensity as noise in the heat flow baseline. &#160;There 
 is no system adjustment that can be made to eliminate this noise. &#160;Fortunately, 
 the noise is typically less than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">+</span> 
 100 µW/cm<span style="vertical-align: Super;">2</span>, which has no effect 
 on the heat flows associated with the photoinitiated events being studied 
 since these heat flows are several orders of magnitude larger.</p>
        <p class="bullet" style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="#top" style="font-size: 8pt;">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Exposure Time</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Photoinitiated curing reactions are fast thermal events. 
 Complete cure is achieved in several seconds to several minutes. This 
 can make differentiating the curing behavior of similar materials difficult 
 even if low light intensities are used. The ability to vary exposure time, 
 therefore, provides an additional experimental variable that can help 
 improve differentiation of behavior and/or provide conditions that better 
 mimic those found in real-world processes (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., 
 photocuring of a film coating as the film rapidly passes under a light 
 source). The PCA connects to the DSC cell via an RS232 cable (DSC Q2000/Q200) 
 or an event cable (DSC Q1000/Q100) that opens and closes a shutter at 
 the light source. Exposure times as short as 0.6 seconds can be selected 
 when setting up a PCA method.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>Temperature</h4>
        <p class="bullet">Most PCA experiments are run isothermally. &#160;The 
 PCA is compatible with the TA Instruments FACS and RCS coolers. &#160;PCA 
 experiments can be performed in the temperature range –50 to 250°C with 
 the dual quartz light guides supplied. &#160;Furthermore, 
 once the PCA experiment is complete, a standard DSC experiment can be 
 run on the fully/partially cured sample material over the broader temperature 
 range covered by the selected cooler by making only a few minor changes 
 to the system.</p>

        <h4>Warranty Information</h4>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;Please 
 take care when using your PCA to protect it from misuse or mishandling. 
 &#160;TA Instruments 
 offers no warranty after the initial installation of the Photocalorimeter 
 Accessory Dual Light Guide or the 200 W Mercury Lamp.</p>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;The 
 life of the standard Extended Range Liquid Dual Light Guide is reduced 
 dramatically if it is exposed for extended periods to temperatures above 
 35°C. &#160;The 
 recommended (default) upper temperature for the PCA experiments is 80°C. 
 This upper limit is based on the fact that the end of the ligh guide, 
 mounted in the adaptor over the cell, "steady states" at 35°C 
 when the cell is held isothermally at 80°C.</p>
