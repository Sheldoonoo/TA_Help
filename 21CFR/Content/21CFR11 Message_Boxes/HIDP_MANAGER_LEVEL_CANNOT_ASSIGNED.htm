        <h4>The System Manager Group cannot be assigned to a user who is a member 
 of another group. If you wish to proceed, you must remove all currently 
 assigned groups, then try again.</h4>
        <p>In order to protect the integrity of the system, a user who is a member 
 of the System Manager Group can ONLY perform those functions assigned 
 to a System Manager. Therefore, multiple groups cannot be assigned to 
 a member of the System Manager Group. If you wish to make this user a 
 member of the System Manager Group, you must remove all other groups that 
 have been assigned to this user before proceeding.</p>
