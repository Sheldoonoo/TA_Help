        <p>The DMA instrument works in conjunction with a controller and associated software to make up a thermal analysis system.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><a name="kanchor21"></a>The Q800 Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer is a precision instrument designed to measure viscoelastic properties, such as modulus and damping of rigid and soft solid materials. &#160;The sample is mounted in the clamp, one part of which is stationary while the other is movable and connected to the drive motor. &#160;Thus, the motor directly affects the deformation of the sample.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The drive motor is used to deliver force or stress to the moving drive block. &#160;This motor is non-contact in nature, in that the fixed motor assembly is not physically in contact with the movable drive block. &#160;The optical encoder measures the resulting displacement of the moving drive block. &#160;For smooth, noise-free and continuous delivery of force, the moving drive block is suspended by an air bearing. &#160;</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The DMA instrument contains all the necessary electronics and software needed to perform experiments and store the results. &#160;There is a flash disk in the cabinet that saves parameters vital to system operations if power is interrupted. &#160;The touch screen enhances the overall ease of use and displays valuable information during setup, calibrations and experimentation. &#160;It has control features such as the ability to setup, start, stop or reject experiments.</p>

        <h3><a name="Defining Viscoelasticity"></a>Defining Viscoelasticity</h3>
        <p>The concept of viscoelasticity comes from the fact that most materials do not exhibit purely elastic (ideal solid-like) or purely viscous (ideal liquid-like) behavior but a combination of both. &#160;This section presents a discussion of ideal solids and liquids and their behavior as it applies to the DMA.</p>
        <h4><a name="Solids" id="Solids"></a>Solids</h4>
        <p>Materials are often referred to as solids or liquids, depending on whether or not they retain their shape under the force of gravity. &#160;An ideal solid is a material that is purely elastic. &#160;When adequate stress is applied to a purely elastic material, it undergoes a deformation, i.e., a change in shape instantaneously. &#160;When that stress is removed, the sample instantaneously regains its initial shape. &#160;The energy involved in the application of stress is stored within the material due to its elasticity, and in turn, it can use that energy to do work when the stress is released. &#160;This is shown below for the example of a spring.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="GIF/DMAElasticDeform_400x253.gif" alt="Elastic Deformation" title="Elastic Deformation" style="border: none;width: 400;height: 253;" align="right" border="0" />It is important to note that there is no time dependence in the behavior of the material, in that the deformations occur the very instant the stress is changed (applied or removed in the example). &#160;This ideal mechanical behavior is described by Hooke’s law in which stress and strain are related through a proportional constant called the modulus of rigidity or simply, modulus (E or G):</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Hooke’s Law:</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">s</span> = E<span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">e</span> (Tension, Compression or Bending)</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">t</span> = G<span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">g</span> (Shear)</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">s</span> &#160;and <span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">t</span> are stress terms</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">e</span> &#160;and <span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">g</span> are strain terms.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor22"></a>By definition, stiffness is the ability of a material to resist deformation. &#160;It is an extrinsic property, i.e., it depends on the size of the sample. &#160;For example, between a thin plate and a thick piece of steel (both of same grade), the latter has a higher stiffness. &#160;Modulus is a measure of the inherent resistance to deformation of a material. &#160;It is an intrinsic property, i.e., it is independent of size. &#160;Thus, the steel samples mentioned above have the same modulus, irrespective of their shapes or sizes.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="#top" style="font-size: 8pt;" class="selected">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <h4><a name="Liquids" id="Liquids"></a>Liquids</h4>
        <p>An ideal liquid is a material that is absolutely devoid of any elasticity or rigidity. &#160;Thus, when placed in a container, an ideal liquid will conform to the shape of the container and find its own level under gravity. &#160;An ideal liquid is unable to store any energy imparted to it upon the application of a stress. &#160;Instead, the liquid undergoes continuous deformation until the stress is removed. &#160;Water is a good approximation to an ideal liquid. &#160;When placed in a beaker, it assumes the shape of the beaker and finds its own level in it. &#160;Next, consider an inclined plane, upon whose top end, one pours the water out of the beaker. &#160;Since gravity is acting as a stress on the water, there will be a continuous flow down the incline. &#160;If one could imagine that we are able to eliminate gravity, then the water would stop flowing farther down the incline and stay in that location. &#160;The absence of elasticity prevents it from flowing back up the incline to its initial location at the top. &#160;This kind of viscous behavior is addressed by Newton’s Law of Viscosity.</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="GIF/ViscousFlow_400x269.gif" alt="Viscous Flow" title="Viscous Flow" style="border: none;width: 400;height: 269;" align="left" border="0" />Newton’s Law:</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">t</span> = <span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">h</span>d<span style="font-size: 11pt;font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">g</span>/dt</p>
        <p>A simple graphical representation of the behavior of an ideal fluid is shown in the figure to the left. An ideal fluid will deform continuously under the application of a stress but will not recover when the stress is removed. &#160;The strain developed under the application of the stress is a function of time until the stress is removed. &#160;The proportionality factor <span style="font-family: Symbol, fantasy;">h</span> is called the <span style="font-style: italic;">coefficient of viscosity</span>. &#160;A Newtonian Fluid is one whose viscosity is independent of the applied shear rate. &#160;</p>

        </p>
        <h4><a name="Viscoelastic Behavior"></a>Viscoelastic Behavior</h4>
        <p>As stated earlier, the concept of viscoelasticity comes from the fact that most materials do not exhibit purely elastic (ideal solids) or purely viscous (ideal liquids) behavior but a combination of both. &#160;When as stress is applied to a viscoelastic material, it will show time-dependent deformation. &#160;Any viscoelastic material, given enough time, will flow under an applied stress. &#160;When the stress is removed the material will not fully recover. &#160;The portion of strain that is recovered represents the energy stored or the elastic portion of the material’s response. &#160;The portion of the strain that is not recovered represents the energy dissipated or viscous portion of the material’s response. &#160;Viscoelastic behavior of a material is shown graphically in the figure below.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="GIF/ViscoelasticResponse.gif" alt="Viscoelastic Response (The Voigt Model)" title="Viscoelastic Response (The Voigt Model)" style="border: none;" width="452" height="245" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>As an example of a viscoelastic response, consider holding a tennis ball in you hand with your arm straight out. &#160;If you drop the tennis ball on the ground it will not bounce back to the same height from which you dropped it. &#160;The height to which the ball bounced back represents the elastic response of the material and the remainder represents the viscous portion (shown in the figure below). &#160;The more elastic the material, the more it will bounce back to the original height from which it was dropped.</p>
