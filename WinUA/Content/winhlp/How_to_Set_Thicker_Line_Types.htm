        <h1>How to Set Thicker Line Types</h1>
        <p><span style="color: black;">In order to make clear, readable overhead transparencies or other types of presentation materials, you may wish to have the plots and analysis information obtained from Universal Analysis appear larger, with all text and drawn lines thicker (bolder).</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">This can be accomplished several ways:</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="border-bottom: 1.50pt solid teal;"><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Increasing Pen Width</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Making lines thicker is accomplished by increasing the "Pen Width" setting in the</span><a href="Win_Export_Plot.htm">Export Plot dialog</a><span style="color: black;">. Note that there is a different pen width setting for each export destination, so you must first select "Printer" as your destination and then set the pen width. If you press the Export button, then the plot will be made immediately and the setting will not be remembered for the next print. But, if you press Save the setting will be remembered for that destination until you change it. It is OK to press Save to store the setting and then press Cancel to skip the immediate output. A setting of 8 for Pen Width gives a very thick line. In a similar fashion to the above, you can customize line thickness for the clipboard and disk files.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="border-bottom: 1.50pt solid teal;"><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Changing Plot Fonts</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">To make the text of the plot larger and thicker you will need to change the font for each portion of the plot. This is accomplished on the</span><a href="Win_Main_Options_font_page.htm">Main Options  Font Page</a><span style="color: black;">under the File menu. In general, you should set the "Size" of each font to either the next larger number, or even two steps bigger. This will make the text larger. Then, select "Bold" text. This will make the text thicker. You may find it useful to try different font sizes until the plot looks correct.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">One problem with very large text is that some of the text on the plot may overlap. This is especially a problem with axis labels and tick labels. One solution to this is to change the scaling with "Manual Rescale" to reduce the number of tick labels or number of digits in each label (i.e., the tick label "1.5" with two digits may fit nicely where as the tick label "1.25" with three digits may not). You could also eliminate tick labels along the axis except at the top and bottom of the axis. The font size changes are global and cannot be set differently for each output destination.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body_Text">NOTE: Changes in line thickness and font size do not show up on the screen plot. You must use print preview to see changes in text size. Changes in line thickness will only show up on the printer itself.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="border-bottom: 1.50pt solid teal;"><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Saving These Settings for the Future</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Universal Analysis has the ability to remember settings for specific purposes, such as for overhead transparencies, in two different ways:</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">The first is to save specific settings in an initialization (ini) file by pressing the Save button on each dialog where you have made a setting change. After all settings are set as desired, you can save your current ini file with a specific name for recall when you want to use this group of settings again. You can save an ini file with a specific name by going to the File menu and selecting the</span><a href="Win_Main_Options_initialization_page.htm">Main Options  Initialization page</a><span style="color: black;">. When you want to use the settings again, just go to the Options dialog and Load your special ini file.</span>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="color: black;">Another way to save settings is to save a session file for the program after everything is set up as desired. When you open the session file again, the settings will be restored. You can save a session file by selecting File/</span><a href="Menu_file_save_session.htm">Save Session</a><span style="color: black;">. Some advantages of using a session file over an ini file are that you do not have to switch back and forth between ini files and, if you are making a number of similar transparencies, then you can set up an example (template) of each one in the saved session and open new files with "Params Same As" one of the template files.</span>
