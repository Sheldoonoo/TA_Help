        <h4><a name="kanchor171"></a>Single point temperature calibration saved.</h4>
        <p>This is a status message recording that a single point temperature calibration 
 has been saved to the instrument.</p>
        <p>Temperature calibration is based on a run in which a temperature standard 
 (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., indium) is heated through 
 its melting transition using the same conditions to be used in subsequent 
 measures (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., heating rate 
 and purge gas). The recorded melting point of this standard is compared 
 to the known melting point and the difference is calculated for temperature 
 calibration. Up to five standards may be used for temperature calibration. 
 A single-point calibration shifts the sample temperature by a constant 
 amount. A two- or more-point calibration shifts the temperature by a constant 
 amount below the first point, uses a smooth curve through the calibration 
 points and shifts by a constant amount after the last point.</p>
        <p>A multiple-point calibration is more accurate than a one-point calibration. 
 A single-point calibration shifts the sample temperature by a constant 
 amount. A two- or more-point calibration shifts the temperature by a constant 
 amount below the first point, uses a smooth curve through the calibration 
 points and maintains a constant temperature shift after the last point.
