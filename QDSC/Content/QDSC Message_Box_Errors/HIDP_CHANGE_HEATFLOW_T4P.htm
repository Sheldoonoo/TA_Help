        <h4>Heat flow results using this pan type are not optimized. See online 
 help for further details. Are you sure you want to make this change?</h4>
        <p>When using the T4P heat flow, consider the following information when 
 selecting the pan type for your experiments.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Pan Resistance Correction</p>
        <p>The DSC Q1000 provides a more accurate measurement of true sample heat 
 flow by accounting for heat flow within the DSC cell sensor as well as 
 between the sensor and the sample pan. The resultant sample heat flow 
 is designated as T4P heat flow.</p>
        <p>The heat flow between the sensor and sample pan is primarily affected 
 by the sample pan thermal resistance, which, in turn, is a function of 
 the pan material (thermal conductivity) and temperature, assuming that 
 both the pan and sensor are perfectly flat surfaces and in intimate contact. 
 This assumption, however, is not true, even if careful experimental procedure 
 is followed when preparing samples. Therefore, the thermal resistance 
 of the thin layer of purge gas between the pan and sensor must also be 
 considered.</p>
        <p>TA Instruments has included in the Q Series Thermal Advantage software 
 fixed values for both pan and purge gas thermal resistances. The supported 
 pan choices include aluminum, alodined aluminum, hermetic aluminum, gold, 
 and hermetic gold. Purge gas choices include air, nitrogen, oxygen, helium. 
 &#160;When running 
 experiments where T4P heat flow is being measured, select the pan type 
 and purge gas that will be used. If you are using a pan type and/or purge 
 gas that is not among &#160;the 
 supported choices listed, you will receive this message.</p>
