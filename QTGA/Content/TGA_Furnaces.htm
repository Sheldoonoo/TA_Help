        <p>The TGA furnace controls the atmosphere and temperature around the sample. This document describes the types of furnaces used with the TGA Q Series instruments.</p>
        <h3>Standard Furnace</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="gif/tgafigure_150x177.gif" alt="Auto TGA with Standard Furnace" title="Auto TGA with Standard Furnace" style="border: none;width: 150;height: 177;" align="left" border="0" />The standard furnace consists of a furnace housing, a heater, and a furnace bases that moves these parts up (to a closed position) and down (to the open position).</p>
        <p>&#160;This figure shows the closed position on an AutoTGA model.</p>
        <p>The stainless steel <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #00509F;">furnace housing</span></span> has a purge opening on either side to allow gas flow or evacuation. Purge gas enters through a purge fitting on the side of the furnace housing. It then passes through an opening in the heater, flows around the sample pan, and exits through openings on the opposite side of the furnace housing and heater. From here, the evolved gas can be sent through appropriate connections to an external analyzer, if desired.</p>
        <p>The <span style="color: #00509F;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">heater</span></span> is a resistance-wound unit of low thermal mass alumina material that can be heated and cooled rapidly. Controlled heating rates of up to 100째C per minute can be obtained to an upper limits of 1000째C.</p>
        <p>Cooling air enters through the holes in the base of the furnace assembly at the completion of test runs, if desired.</p>
        <p>A Platinell II* <span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #000000;">thermocouple</span></span> extends through the bottom of the balance chamber, down along the hang-down wire, and is positioned just above the sample pan, where it monitors the sample environmental temperature.</p>
        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #00509F;">furnace base</span></span> moves the furnace assembly up around the sample pan to the closed position or down away from the sample pan to the open position.</p>

        <h3>Evolved Gas Analyzer Furnace</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="gif/FurnaceTGA7_150x220.gif" alt="EGA Furnace Schematic" title="EGA Furnace Schematic" style="border: none;width: 150;height: 220;" align="right" border="0" />
            <img src="gif/TGAQ50cutout_150x167.gif" alt="TGA Q50 with EGA Furnace" title="TGA Q50 with EGA Furnace" style="border: none;width: 150;height: 167;" align="left" border="0" />The Evolved Gas Analyzer (EGA) Furnace is an optional accessory for the TGA that allows you to connect a spectrometer to the instrument so that the gases evolved by sample decomposition can be analyzed.</p>
        <p>The EGA furnace (schematic shown on the right) consists of a quartz glass sample tube surrounded by an electric resistance heater, both of which are contained within a water-cooled furnace housing. The housing is mounted to a furnace base that raises and lowers the furnace for sample loading and unloading.</p>
        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #00509F;">sample tube</span></span> has a purge gas inlet that passes through the right side of the furnace housing. A fitting on the left side of the housing allows connection of a transfer line to carry exhaust gas to a spectrometer such as a mass spectrometer. Because the heater is external to the sample tube, evolved gases from sample decomposition within the sample tube do not come in contact with the resistance elements of the furnace ceramic refractory.</p>
        <p>Cooling air enters through the furnace base and passes upward between the outside of the sample tube and the inside of the furnace, completely separating the cooling air from the sample and the sample zone.</p>
        <p>The <span style="color: #00509F;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">furnace</span></span> is a resistance heater wound on alumina ceramic, which allows sample zone temperatures as high as 1000째C with heating rates up to 50째C/min.</p>
        <p>A Platinel II* <span style="color: #00509F;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">thermocouple</span></span> is positioned in the furnace, just above the sample pan, where it monitors the sample environment temperature.</p>
        <p>The <span style="color: #00509F;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">furnace base</span></span> moves the furnace assembly up around the sample pan to the closed position, or down away from the sample pan to the open position.</p>
        <p class="Notes">NOTE: <span style="font-style: italic;">&#160;</span>The EGA furnace and the standard TGA furnace can be exchanged easily on the instrument after initial hardware installation.</p>
