            <img src="../QDSC Images/Q10PCellCutout.gif" alt="Pressure DSC Cell" style="border: none;width: 100px;height: 177px;border-style: none;float: right;border-style: none;float: right;" width="100" height="177" align="right" border="0" />The Pressure DSC (PDSC) cell (shown to the right) is a 
 DSC cell enclosed in a steel cylinder that can be pressurized to 7 MPa 
 gauge (1000 psig). In addition to performing most of the same basic measurements 
 as a standard DSC cell, the PDSC cell can operate at elevated pressure 
 or under vacuum. This ability to vary pressure as well as temperature 
 provides the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Resolution of overlapping 
 peaks</li>
            <li value="2">Determination of heats of 
 vaporization and vapor pressure</li>
            <li value="3">Reaction rates in controlled 
 atmospheres</li>
            <li value="4">Studies of pressure-sensitive 
 reactions</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a name="kanchor56"></a>The Pressure DSC cell has two gas flow control valves, a three-way valve, 
 a pressure gauge, a pressure release valve, and gas pressure fittings 
 on the side. An 8.3 MPa gauge (1200 psig) pressure relief valve and a 
 pressure transducer are contained in the base of the cell.</p>
        <p>The Pressure DSC cell uses a constantan (thermoelectric) disc as a primary 
 heat-transfer element producing Heat Flow T1. A silver heating block, 
 capped with a vented silver lid, encloses the constantan disc. The selected 
 sample and an inert reference are placed in pans that sit on raised portions 
 of the disc. Heat is transferred through the constantan disc to both the 
 sample and the reference pans. Differential heat flow to the sample and 
 reference are monitored by the CHROMEL®-constantan area thermocouples. 
 The thermocouples are formed at the junctions of the constantan disc and 
 the CHROMEL® wafers welded to the underside of the two raised portions 
 of the disc. CHROMEL® and ALUMEL® wires are connected to the sample CHROMEL® 
 wafer at the thermocouple junction to measure sample temperature. An ALUMEL® 
 wire is welded to the reference wafer for thermal balance. &#160;The 
 furnace control thermocouple is CHROMEL®-constantan.</p>

 in the Pressure DSC cell’s base, is preheated to block temperature by 
 circulation before entering the sample chamber through the purge gas inlet. 
 Gas exits through the vent hole in the silver lid.</p>
        <p>The Pressure DSC cell is available as an optional operator-replaceable 
 cell for the DSC Q2000/Q1000 (shown in the figure to the right). &#160;</p>
        <p>It is also available as part of an integrated DSC Q10P/Q20P system (shown 
 in the figure below).</p>

        <h4 style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a name="kanchor57"></a><a name="kanchor58"></a>Please read this before using oxygen in the Pressure DSC 
 Cell</h4>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;If 
 excessive amounts of hydrocarbons are present in the Pressure DSC (PDSC), 
 energetic combustion could occur causing damage to the Pressure DSC cell 
 and possible injury to the operator. &#160;To 
 help prevent these problems, follow the guidelines below:</p>
        <p class="Warnings" style="text-align: left;" align="left">WARNING: &#160;(1) 
 &#160;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clean 
 Supply Lines</span>: &#160;The 
 oxygen supply lines, valves, gauges, and regulators must all be free of 
 hydrocarbons and rated for oxygen service. &#160;Check 
 with your supplier if you are uncertain whether a component is rated for 
 oxygen service. &#160;If 
 the inside of the tubing smells “oily” or has liquid or a black carbon 
 residue in it, hydrocarbons may be present. &#160;Consult 
 with your compressed gas suppliers for a cleaning procedure.</p>

 &#160;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cell 
 Contamination</span>: &#160;Remove 
 the pressure housing and visually inspect the Pressure DSC cell for oil 
 or other organic contamination. &#160;The 
 entire oxygen pressure system must be free of hydrocarbons. &#160;If 
 there is a possibility of hydrocarbon contamination (spilled samples, 
 oily residue, oily smell, carbon black, etc.) in your Pressure DSC cell, 
 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately 
 discontinue use</span>. &#160;Contact 
 TA Instruments Service at (302) 427-4050 to schedule a safety inspection 
 or for additional information.</p>

 DSC cells. &#160;</p>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;Hydrogen 
 gas should be used with extreme care. &#160;It 
 is highly flammable when exposed to flame or oxidizing materials. &#160;[The 
 Sax Safety Handbook, Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, indicates 
 that the lower explosion limit (LEL) under ambient conditions for hydrogen 
 is 4.1% in air. &#160;Care 
 should be taken to keep the concentration below this value.] &#160;When 
 using hydrogen in the Pressure DSC cell, the cell should be initially 
 purged thoroughly with helium before introducing hydrogen. &#160;</p>
        <p class="Cautions">CAUTION: &#160;When 
 hydrogen or helium is used as a pressurizing gas, the maximum temperature 
 &#160;or maximum 
 heating rate may be less than the specification. </p>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;At 
 the end of the experiment, the cell should be vented into an exhaust hood 
 and repurged with helium prior to opening the pressure container.</p>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;Check

        <h4>Chemical Safety</h4>
        <p>Use only the purge gases listed in <a href="Purge_Gases_and_Flow_Rates.htm">Purge 
 Gases and Flow Rates</a>. Use of other gases could cause damage to the

        <h4>Electrical Safety</h4>
        <p class="Cautions">CAUTION: &#160;The 
 hold-down thumbscrews that hold the DSC pressure cell in place ensures 
 proper mating with the electrical connections. &#160;You 
 cannot run experiments without them. &#160;If 
 they are not fully in place, the instrument may not be able to apply power 
 to the cell and will not operate.</p>
        <p>You must unplug the instrument before doing any maintenance or repair 
 work; voltages as high as 120/240 Vac are present in this system.</p>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;High 
 voltages are present in this instrument. &#160;Maintenance 
 and repair of internal parts must be performed only by TA Instruments 
 or other qualified service personnel.</p>
        <p class="Warnings">WARNING: &#160;Drying 
 out the DSC cell may be needed, if it has been exposed to humid conditions. 
 It is important to be certain that the instrument ground is adequately 
 connected to the facilities ground for safe operation. &#160;Run 
 the "<a href="Setting_Up_a_DSC_Cell_Cooler_Conditioning_Procedure.htm">Cell/Cooler 
 Conditioning</a>" test template to dry out the cell: &#160;(1) 
 &#160;Ramp at 
 10°C/min to 400°C (2) &#160;Isothermal

        <h4>Thermal Safety</h4>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The cell surfaces can be hot enough 
 to burn the skin during a sample run. &#160;If 
 you are conducting a subambient test using the DSC pressure cell, cold 
 could also cause injury.</span> &#160;After 
 running any type of experiment, you must allow the pressure cell to return 
 to room temperature before you touch the inner cell surfaces.</p>

        <h4><a name="Lapping the Silver Lid and Ring"></a>Lapping the Silver Lid 
 and Ring</h4>
        <p>If sinusoidal baseline noise is observed in a PDSC heat flow curve obtained 
 under pressure, the silver lid and gas ring (the silver ledge on which 
 the lid sits) may have become slightly warped and should be smoothed with 
 the lapping tool before the next run. The lapping tool is provided with 
 the PDSC Cell.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="1">Place the 
 silver lid, handle side up, on a piece of fine (600 grit) emery paper 
 backed by a flat, smooth surface, and move the lid in a figure-eight motion 
 until any deformed areas are smoothed.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="2">To smooth 
 the gas ring, attach a piece of abrasive paper (400 grit) to the lapping 
 tool with the double-sided tape provided. Trim the paper to the size of 
 the tool using scissors or a razor knife. Rotate the lapping tool (PN 
 008837.001) back and forth on the ring with light-to-moderate pressure. 
 Clean afterward with a fiberglass brush and a light air blast.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Notes">NOTE: &#160;Be 
 sure to wear safety glasses or goggles when cleaning the cell with air.</p>
