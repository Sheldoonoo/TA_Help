        <h1>Invalid Tzero File</h1>
        <h4><a name="kanchor497"></a>Invalid Tzero file.</h4>
        <p>The DSC Tzero file is not valid. You will need to either use a valid 
 Tzero file or produce a new file.</p>
        <p>The DSC Tzero calibration requires two experiments. &#160;The 
 first experiment is done without samples or pans (baseline); the second 
 is performed with sapphire disks (without pans) on both the sample and 
 reference positions. &#160;Both 
 experiments use the same method beginning with a cell preheat followed 
 by an equilibration at an initial temperature, holding isothermal for 
 5 minutes, heating at constant rate to a final temperature and holding 
 isothermal for 5 minutes. &#160;The 
 range of temperatures should be at least as broad as the desired experimental 
 range. &#160;Tzero 
 calibration is less sensitive to heating rate changes. &#160;However, 
 for the best results, calibration should be performed under the identical 
 experimental conditions as that used for subsequent sample runs (cooler 
 type, purge gas, and flow rate). &#160;This 
 calibration determines the thermal capacitance and resistance of both 
 the sample and reference sensors of the DSC cell.</p>
        <p>Tzero calibration is only used with the DSC Q100 and Q1000 for Heat 
 Flow T4 and T4P.</p>
