        <p class="Tip-Note-Text" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor471"></a>The cook, the painter, the heart surgeon and the drilling fluid engineer 
 are all concerned with the flow properties of materials, and therefore, 
 whether they know it or not, with the science of rheology. The word itself 
 was not coined until the 1920’s, but the flow of liquids has been the 
 subject of study for millennia. This study was first formalised by Isaac 
 Newton, in the late seventeenth century, who observed that some liquids 
 could be made to flow more easily than others, and that the flow rate 
 of each material depended on the impetus to which they were subjected.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Newton lacked the vocabulary of modern materials science, and his discussion 
 is not easy to follow, but the concepts involved are now described by 
 rigorously defined terms, in particular stress (usually given the symbol 
 <span style="font-family: Symbol;">s</span>) and strain (<span style="font-family: Symbol;">g</span>). 
 Although these are commonly used interchangeably, in materials science 
 they have distinct and precise meanings. Stress is the force, acting over 
 an area, applied to a sample; strain is the amount by which it moves in 
 response to the stress. The viscosity (<span style="font-family: Symbol;">h</span>) of 
 a liquid is then defined as the stress divided by the rate of change of 
 strain (d<span style="font-family: Symbol;">g</span>/dt or <img src="BMP00008.gif" alt="image\BMP00008.gif" style="width: 12px;height: 21px;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="12" height="21" border="0" />). Newton’s original 
 postulate can then be phrased as that the viscosity of a material is constant: 
 the stress is proportional to the flow rate. The more easily a liquid 
 flows, the lower the viscosity.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor472"></a>The behaviour of some materials, such as low molecular weight liquids, 
 complies with Newton’s postulate, and can easily be predicted from a few 
 simple experiments. But as the cook, the painter, and the others are aware, 
 many materials show behaviour patterns which are highly complex. To predict 
 how such materials will respond to a particular process is not always 
 straightforward. Most of the traditional test methods used to measure 
 viscosity (falling bars or balls, rolling balls, U tubes, efflux cups, 
 simple rotational viscometers, and so on) can be used to predict the behaviour 
 of materials during some processes, but not others. But modern rheometers 
 are designed to be extremely flexible in their operation, capable of covering 
 many processes and many types of behaviour. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor473"></a><a name="kanchor474"></a>The commonest form of non-Newtonian behaviour is shear-thinning, or 
 pseudoplasticity, when the viscosity is not constant but decreases with 
 increasing stress. Many industrial particulate dispersions, and polymer 
 solutions and melts, are shear-thinning, which can be an extremely useful 
 property. Typical are non-drip paints, which need to have a high viscosity 
 under low stress, to prevent sedimentation, slumping or dripping, but 
 a low viscosity at high stress for ease of application. Similar considerations 
 apply to many printing inks, drilling fluids, cosmetics, pharmaceutical 
 suspensions, foodstuffs, polymers and so on. A face cream must be relatively 
 stiff and creamy to the touch, but spread easily on the skin. Drilling 
 fluids need to have a high viscosity on standing, to hold suspended particles, 
 but a low viscosity during pumping.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor475"></a>The reasons for shear thinning are often complex, and vary between materials. 
 In polymer gels, pectin and gelatin for example, it occurs because of 
 the rupture of junction zones of attraction between adjacent polymer molecules. 
 In flocculated colloidal dispersions such as yoghurts, the flocs are broken 
 down into smaller units, and eventually into primary particles. In deflocculated, 
 stable, dispersions, shearing will align the particles into two dimensional 
 arrays, facilitating flow. A few materials will shear-thicken, usually 
 high solids dispersions; this effect is almost invariably undesirable.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor476"></a>Not only can the viscosity of materials depend on the magnitude of the 
 applied stress, it may also depend on the length of time for which the 
 stress is applied. The viscosity of most dispersions will decrease with 
 time after the imposition of a stress, and will take time to recover after 
 its removal; this effect is known as thixotropy. Like pseudoplasticity, 
 a reasonable degree of thixotropy is often useful, for example it enables 
 surface coatings to flow out after application, removing irregularities, 
 before they stiffen. A third variable which can alter the viscosity of 
 materials is temperature; the viscosity of most materials decreases with 
 increasing temperature.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor477"></a>The complete viscometric characterisation of a liquid would therefore 
 require shear rate to be monitored as a function of shear stress, time 
 and temperature, but in practice such completeness is seldom necessary. 
 It is usually enough to identify the conditions and parameters of interest 
 and make the corresponding measurements.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor478"></a><a name="kanchor479"></a><a name="kanchor480"></a>A huge body of viscosity data has now been published for many materials, 
 and it is remarkable that the curves of viscosity, plotted against shear 
 rate, of almost all of these are very similar in shape. The main features 
 of such curves are most easily seen if the data are plotted on logarithmic 
 axes (i.e. with 0.1, 1, 10, 100 etc. equally spaced). At low shear rates 
 a Newtonian region exists, followed at higher rates by shear thinning 
 region which often takes the form of a power law (straight line on logarithmic 
 axes). At still higher rates a second Newtonian region is observed. In 
 some cases the material will eventually shear thicken (Figure 1).</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Figure 1: Proposed Generalized Flow Curve</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The general nature of this curve implies that rather than thinking of 
 Newtonian, shear thinning, or whatever, <span style="font-style: italic;">materials</span>, 
 we might better think of the Newtonian or shear thinning <span style="font-style: italic;">regions</span><a name="kanchor481"></a>. 
 So we might say not that we are working with a shear-thinning sample, 
 but that we are working in the shear-thinning region of that sample. In 
 some cases the complete curve is not accessible from a single experiment, 
 and it is easy to miss this point.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If the shear thickening region is ignored, then it is possible to describe 
 a curve of the form in Figure 1 by four parameters. Two of these the low 
 shear viscosity, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">h</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">0</span><a name="kanchor482"></a>, 
 and the high shear viscosity, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">h</span><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="vertical-align: sub;">¥</span></span>. The 
 shear-thinning part of the curve usually approximates to a straight line 
 when plotted on logarithmic axes, and can therefore be described by a 
 two-parameter power law relationship. Combining gives the equation named 
 after its originator, M.M. Cross:</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>where K is known as the characteristic time of the material. The greater 
 the value of K, the further to the left the curve lies, and the greater 
 the value of the index m, the greater the degree of shear thinning.</p>
