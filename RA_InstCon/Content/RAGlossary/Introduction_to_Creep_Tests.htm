        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor705"></a><a name="kanchor706"></a><a name="kanchor707"></a><a name="kanchor708"></a><a name="kanchor709"></a>Many important processes are driven by very low stresses, such as those 
 produced by gravity or surface tension. These include settling and creaming 
 in dispersions, levelling after application in surface coatings, and slumping 
 and sagging in paints. Moreover the handling properties of some materials 
 are affected by elasticity; the ability to recover in some part their 
 original shape after forced deformation. </p>
        <p>These properties can be investigated using a creep test, in which a 
 very low shearing stress (force acting over an area), <span style="font-family: Symbol;">s</span><a name="kanchor710"></a><a name="kanchor711"></a>, 
 is applied to the sample, and the resulting strain (displacement), <span style="font-family: Symbol;">g</span><a name="kanchor712"></a><a name="kanchor713"></a>, is monitored. It is usual to plot the compliance, 
 J, defined as the strain divided by the stress, against time. If a low 
 stress is placed on a <span style="font-style: italic;">solid</span><a name="kanchor714"></a> sample, 
 it will respond by deforming almost instantaneously to a new position, 
 and then stopping. When the stress is removed, the sample will immediately 
 recover its original dimensions. The compliance will depend on the material: 
 the stiffer the material, the lower the compliance. Typical values are 
 about 10<span style="vertical-align: super;">-3</span> / Pa for a 2% gelatin 
 solution in water, 5 x 10<span style="vertical-align: super;">-5</span> 
 / Pa for foam rubber, 3 x 10<span style="vertical-align: super;">-7</span> 
 / Pa for natural rubber, and 2&#160;x 10<span style="vertical-align: super;">-9</span> 
 / Pa for nylon. Figure 1 shows creep behavior for an ideal solid with 
 a compliance of 10<span style="vertical-align: super;">-3</span><a name="kanchor715"></a> / Pa, 
 the stress being applied at time zero and removed after 1000 sec.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor716"></a>If the stress is placed on a liquid material, it will deform continuously, 
 the rate of deformation being inversely proportional to the viscosity 
 of the liquid. When the stress is removed the sample will cease to deform, 
 and will not show any recovery. Typical values of viscosity are 1 mPa 
 s (milliPascal second) for water, 1 Pa s for glycerine, and about 1000 
 Pa for polymer melts. Figure 2 shows a creep curve for an ideal liquid 
 of viscosity 1 Pa s.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Figure 2: Creep curve for an ideal liquid of viscosity

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Many industrial materials are neither completely solid nor completely 
 liquid. They show properties that are some way between these limiting 
 forms of behavior, and are called viscoelastic. When a stress is placed 
 on a viscoelastic material, the deformation will be retarded. When the 
 stress is removed, the recovery will also be retarded (Figure 3).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;" align="center">
            <img src="BMP00002.gif" alt="image\BMP00002.gif" style="width: 287px;height: 209px;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="287" height="209" border="0" />

        <p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Figure 3: Creep curve for a viscoelastic material showing 
 retarded deformation, with stress applied for 1000 seconds then removed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor717"></a>In some cases, a sample will show both retarded deformation and continuous 
 flow, in which case recovery after removal of the stress will be incomplete 
 (Figure 4).</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;" align="center">
            <img src="BMP00003.gif" alt="image\BMP00003.gif" style="width: 287px;height: 209px;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="287" height="209" border="0" />

        <p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Figure 4: Creep curve for a viscoelastic material showing 
 continuous flow, with stress applied for 1000 seconds, then removed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The elastic properties of the material are then available from the retarded 
 deformation and the recovery parts of the curve, while the continuous 
 flow part provides the viscosity at the applied stress. This is identical 
 to the low shear viscosity obtained from a flow curve.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>For dilute dispersions of monodisperse hard spheres, the settling rate 
 can be predicted form Stokes’ law combined with Archimedes’ principle 
 (Equation 1)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor718"></a>where V is the sedimentation velocity, r is the particle radius, g is 
 the acceleration due to gravity, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">r</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">p</span> 
 and <span style="font-family: Symbol;">r</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">m</span> 
 are the density of the particles and medium respectively, and <span style="font-family: Symbol;">h</span> is the viscosity.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Most industrial dispersions do not fulfill the criteria for this expression, 
 but the viscosity will nonetheless give a qualitative indication of the 
 relative stability to sedimentation of comparable dispersions. In some 
 cases the stability against particle aggregation or emulsion coalescence 
 can also be predicted from the low shear viscosity. Food “stabilisers”, 
 for example, do not impart stability in the thermodynamic sense, but reduce 
 the rate of particle motion by increasing the viscosity of the medium. 
 Similar expressions to Equation 1 exist to predict levelling after application 
 in surface coatings, and sagging or slumping in paint films.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor719"></a>It is also important that industrial and biological materials should 
 have the correct degree of elasticity. A printing ink, for example, will 
 fail to enter the nip if it is too elastic, but will give poor dot definition 
 if it insufficiently so. Contact adhesives are lightly cross-linked, and 
 therefore elastic, to prevent excessive surface wetting. The texture and 
 feel of foodstuffs is in part due to elasticity; butter has relatively 
 low elasticity, jam is highly elastic. Some industrial materials are formulated 
 to be viscoelastic to prevent dripping. After pouring, the ruptured stream 
 will recoil rather than drip.</p>
