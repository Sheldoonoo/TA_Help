        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor727"></a><a name="kanchor728"></a><a name="kanchor729"></a><a name="kanchor730"></a><a name="kanchor731"></a><a name="kanchor732"></a><a name="kanchor733"></a><a name="kanchor734"></a>During a multiwave frequency (MWF) experiment, data is gathered at not 
 only for a single frequency, but also for additional (higher than the 
 fundamental) values, known as harmonic multipliers. The data for all frequency 
 values is gathered in the same time it would take to measure just the 
 fundamental frequency in a standard oscillatory test. These attributes 
 of the MWF technique allow it to be used either as a means to save time 
 when performing frequency sweeps (especially at low frequencies), or as 
 a method of study the viscoelastic properties of a material as a function 
 of both frequency and time/temperature (for instance, when studying a 
 change of state such as cure or gelation.</p>
        <p>There are two main areas where the technique is useful</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-left: -20px;" class="Bullet" value="1"><a name="kanchor735"></a><a name="kanchor736"></a>A quality control, routine, 
 or highly repetitive type of experiment where a rheological dynamic "fingerprint" 
 of the material is all that is required. A measurement at low frequencies 
 (e.g., 0.5 Hz), a medium frequency (e.g., 5 Hz) and a high frequency (e.g., 
 20 Hz) could give a measurement of the material’s property in its viscous, 
 transition and elastic regions.</li>
            <li style="margin-left: -20px;" class="Bullet" value="2"><a name="kanchor737"></a>Where fast changing or curing 
 samples are being measured. MWF obviates the need to do repeat tests at 
 different frequencies by obtaining the maximum amount of rheological data 
 from a single experiment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Validation of the technique is made difficult due to the time-varying 
 nature of the experiment. The frequencies chosen must be high compared 
 with the time of the experiment, so that the rheological properties do 
 not change significantly within one cycle of the fundamental.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor738"></a><a name="kanchor739"></a>The MWF technique must be used with care. Careful validation of the 
 torques and amplitudes used and produced must be conducted initially. 
 More information regarding the expected results must be obtained prior 
 to an actual experiment than in a standard oscillation experiment. Used 
 with care, however, the technique is extremely useful and time saving.</p>

        <h3>Performing a MWF Test</h3>
        <p><a name="kanchor740"></a>The software allows any integer harmonic multiplier up to the 40<span style="vertical-align: super;">th</span><a name="kanchor741"></a><a name="kanchor742"></a><a name="kanchor743"></a> to be added together with the 
 fundamental. The ratio of the torque amplitude can be, if required, adjusted 
 at each frequency relative to the fundamental. This is an important feature 
 since the amplitude will decrease with increasing frequency for the same 
 applied stress, for most materials. Inertial effects, both fluid and instrument 
 based, will reduce the amplitude of the strain wave. This can lead to 
 very small amplitude signals (possibly at or below the instrument resolution) 
 at the highest harmonic multiplier. To overcome this potential problem, 
 the torque at each harmonic multiplier is selected to be higher than the 
 fundamental by a user definable ratio, such that the strain amplitude 
 at the higher frequencies is of similar order to that of the fundamental.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor744"></a>To ensure that the resulting data is meaningful and valid, it is necessary 
 to ensure that the minimum and maximum torques used are within the working 
 range of the instrument. At any given instant, the torques at the different 
 harmonic multipliers will add together in a mathematically complex way. 
 The worst case is when all of the harmonic multipliers are in phase with 
 the fundamental. It is important, therefore, to ensure that the instrument 
 has sufficient torque to achieve the desired strain.</p>
        <p>It is also necessary to ensure that the total strains do not add up 
 to a value that is greater than the linear viscoelastic limit of the material 
 under test. The best way to validate a MWF technique with a material is 
 described below.</p>

            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="1">Perform a 
 torque sweep to establish the linear viscoelastic region (LVR) at a particular 
 frequency, such as 1 Hz.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="2">Determine 
 the strain at which you start to see departure from linear behavior.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="3"><a name="kanchor745"></a><a name="kanchor746"></a>Divide this 
 displacement value by the number of frequencies that you wish to include 
 in your multiwave procedure. This should be limited to a maximum of five 
 for good resolution of the individual waveforms.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="4">The value 
 you derive for the strain should be within the instrument's working range. 
 If it is not, then the number of frequencies chosen will need to be less 
 than five. This is to ensure that, if you get waveform reinforcement, 
 you do not exceed the sample’s LVR.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="5"><a name="kanchor747"></a>Perform a 
 controlled strain frequency sweep over the range of interest, using the 
 strain derived in step 2.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="6">Make a note 
 of the torque value in the data table for the lowest frequency.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="7">Choose the 
 other frequencies (greater than the fundamental selected in the previous 
 step) at which you wish to measure.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="8">Divide these

 multipliers.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="9">Look up the 
 torque values nearest to the frequencies of interest and divide by the 
 torque at the fundamental. Enter these values as the torque ratio at each 
 harmonic multiplier.</li>
