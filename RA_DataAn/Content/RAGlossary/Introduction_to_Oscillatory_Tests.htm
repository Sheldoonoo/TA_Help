        <p class="Tip-Note-Text" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p>We learn at an early age that materials may be gases, liquids or solids. 
 But this is an oversimplification. Many industrial materials show behaviour 
 which is neither completely liquid nor completely solid, but is somewhere 
 between the two. Such materials are termed viscoelastic. Typical examples 
 are polymer solutions and melts, and particulate dispersions such as paints, 
 inks, drilling fluids, creams and lotions, and many types of foodstuffs.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor484"></a>It is viscoelasticity which is responsible, at least in part, for the 
 handling properties of these materials, and it is important that they 
 should exhibit it in the correct degree. For example if a printing ink 
 is too elastic (solid) it will fail to enter the nip, whereas if it is 
 too liquid it will show poor dot definition. There are several ways of 
 examining the viscoelastic properties of materials, but the commonest, 
 and most versatile, is to use oscillatory rheology. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If a sinusoidal stress, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">s</span> (force acting over 
 an area), is placed on a <span style="font-style: italic;">solid</span> 
 sample, a sinusoidal displacement (strain, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">g</span>) 
 will result which is in phase with the applied stress. The modulus, or 
 stiffness, of the material can be obtained by dividing the amplitude of 
 the stress, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">s</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">0</span>, 
 by the amplitude of the strain, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">g</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">0</span> 
 (Figure 1):</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>If a sinusoidal stress is applied to a <span style="font-style: italic;">liquid</span> 
 sample, the stress is in phase with the rate of change of strain, and 
 a phase lag of 90° is therefore introduced between the stress and the 
 strain (Figure 2):</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Figure 2: Strain Response to a Sinusoidally-Applied Stress 
 for a Liquid Material</p>
        <p class="Tip-Note-Text" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p>For viscoelastic materials, the phase angle, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">d</span>, 
 will be somewhere between 0° and 90°. The ratio of the stress to the strain 
 amplitude therefore gives the stiffness of the material, and the phase 
 angle describes its viscoelastic nature. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The degree to which a material behaves as a solid or liquid depends 
 on the timescale of the observation. Water is usually described as a liquid, 
 of course, but if examined over timescales of less than about a nanosecond, 
 would appear to be a solid. Ice behaves as a liquid under very high stresses, 
 over periods of years, hence glacier flow. It happens that the materials 
 which are listed above as being viscoelastic show a transition from liquid 
 to solid behaviour over typical laboratory timescales. To examine more 
 precisely the transition time, the frequency, <span style="font-family: Symbol;">w</span>, 
 of the applied stress can be varied. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The usual method of performing an oscillation experiment is to apply 
 a sinusoidal stress to a sample, over a range of frequencies, and to monitor 
 the strain and phase angle. The stress is kept low so that it can be assumed 
 that the unperturbed properties of the sample are determined. Rather than 
 reporting <span style="font-family: Symbol;">s</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">0</span> 
 / <span style="font-family: Symbol;">g</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">0</span> 
 and phase angle directly, it is more usual to report the storage modulus, 
 G<span style="font-family: Symbol;">¢</span>, and loss modulus, G<span style="font-family: Symbol;">²</span>. 
 These are defined as G<span style="font-family: Symbol;">¢</span> = <span style="font-family: Symbol;">s</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">0</span> cos <span style="font-family: Symbol;">d</span>/ <span style="font-family: Symbol;">g</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">0</span> and 
 G<span style="font-family: Symbol;">²</span> = <span style="font-family: Symbol;">s</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">0</span> 
 sin <span style="font-family: Symbol;">d</span>/ <span style="font-family: Symbol;">g</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">0</span>. 
 The advantage of this is that G<span style="font-family: Symbol;">¢</span> represents 
 the “solid” component of the material, and G<span style="font-family: Symbol;">²</span> 
 the “liquid” component. The viscosity of a liquid with no solid component 
 would actually be G<span style="font-family: Symbol;">²</span> / <span style="font-family: Symbol;">w</span>.

        <p class="Tip-Note-Text" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor485"></a><a name="kanchor486"></a><a name="kanchor487"></a><a name="kanchor488"></a>Just as polymers show broad transitions in melting point, sometimes 
 over many decades of temperature, so they show transitions over broad 
 frequency ranges. In general, the higher the molecular weight, the broader 
 the range. A material like children’s silly putty shows a range centred 
 on a frequency of about 10 rads sec<span style="vertical-align: super;">-1</span>, 
 equivalent to a time of 0.1 sec. (Figure 3). If examined over shorter 
 timescales, for example by bouncing, it appears to be a solid. Over longer 
 timescales it flows like a liquid. A deflocculated dispersion shows solid 
 properties at frequencies which depend on the system, but are typically 
 above about 10 rads sec<span style="vertical-align: super;">-1</span>. 
 Flocculated dispersions show transitions at much lower frequencies, which 
 is why emulsion paints in the can appear as soft solids, but traditional 
 oil paints as stiff liquids. Similarly jam is wobbly and solid-like (low 
 frequency transition), honey is liquid-like (high frequency transition), 
 although they are of similar “stiffness.”</p>
