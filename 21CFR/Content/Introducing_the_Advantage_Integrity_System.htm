        <p><a name="kanchor4"></a><a name="kanchor5"></a><a name="kanchor6"></a>The Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures Rule (21 CFR Part 11) 
 was established by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
 to define the requirements for submitting documentation in electronic 
 form and the criteria for approved electronic signatures. &#160;TA 
 Instruments understands the importance of this rule and has developed 
 software with this regulatory compliance in mind. &#160;Section 
 11.3 defines a <span style="font-style: italic;"><a name="kanchor7"></a>closed system</span> 
 as "<span style="font-style: italic;">an environment in which the 
 system access is controlled by persons who are responsible for the content 
 of electronic records that are on the system.</span>" &#160;TA 
 Instruments' Advantage Integrity software is a closed system. &#160;To 
 fully comply with the rule, it is important for an organization that uses 
 electronic records and electronic signatures to have Standard Operating 
 Procedures (SOPs) that support and complement the Advantage Integrity 
 software functionality.</p>
        <p>The 21 CFR Part 11 rule specifies that electronic signature capabilities 
 are optional. &#160;The 
 Advantage Integrity software does not provide electronic signatures. Therefore, 
 sections 11.50, 11.70, 11.100, 11.200, and 11.300 do not apply to this 
 software. &#160;</p>

        <h3><a name="Using an Integrity-Licensed Instrument"></a>Using an Integrity-Licensed 
 Instrument</h3>
        <p>Once an instrument has been set up with an Advantage Integrity license, 
 it will become part of the Advantage Integrity system. &#160;Access 
 will be controlled, data will be stored in the Oracle database, and an 
 audit trail will record events. Once you are logged in to the instrument, 
 the basic operation of an Integrity instrument is the same as its non-Integrity 
 (standard) counterpart for calibrating, setting up experiments, and starting 
 runs. &#160;</p>
        <p>The few differences are noted here. &#160;</p>
        <ul>

 if there are instrument audit trail messages to be transferred. During 
 the audit trail transfer do not close the instrument control window. You 
 may also see this window when closing the instrument control window.</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">SUID# 
 (applies to thermal analysis only):</span> &#160;&#160;Instead

 a SUID# to the original, raw data record. &#160;This 
 number can be seen on the Summary Page of the Experimental View.</li>

        <p>Universal Analysis can access and analyze data stored in the Integrity

 logged into the Integrity system, only database records can be accessed. 
 &#160;A secure

 all actions performed while logged into the database, including the logging 
 in/logging out process. &#160;There

        <h3><a name="Using an Integrity-Licensed Rheology Data Analysis"></a>Using 
 an Integrity-Licensed Rheology Data Analysis</h3>
        <p>Rheology Advantage™ 
 can access and analyze data stored in the Integrity database system as 
 well as data stored in traditional data files (historical data). &#160;A 
 secure audit trail is generated for all actions performed while logged 
 into the database that results in a committed report. &#160;No 
 audit trail is generated while accessing historical data.</p>
        <p>Most of the functions available in the Integrity-licensed Rheology Advantage 
 program are the same as those provided in its non-Integrity counterpart.</p>
        <p>The differences between the programs are noted below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet" value="1"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Logging 
 In</span>: &#160;Before 
 accessing records in the Integrity database you must <a href="Accessing_the_System.htm">log 
 into the database</a> using a valid user name and password. &#160;Selecting 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Cancel</span> on the 
 Log-in window will open the non-Integrity version of Rheology Advantage 
 Data Analysis. </li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Opening 
 Files</span>: &#160;After 
 logging into the database you will need to locate the data from your experiment. 
 &#160;Select 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">File/Open</span>. &#160;The 
 <a href="Browsing_the_Database.htm">Database Viewer</a> will be displayed. 
 Use the searching and sorting functions of the Database Viewer to locate 
 and highlight the desired record. &#160;The 
 only records displayed in the viewer will be those assigned to projects 
 to which you have access rights. &#160;To 
 open the file, click the <img src="BUTTON_OPEN_FILE.BMP" style="border: none;width: 26px;height: 28px;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="26" height="28" border="0" /> button or select <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">File/Open</span>.

 or Unavailable Functions</span>: &#160;The 
 system administrator can use the TA System Manager program to <a href="Setting_Up_Groups.htm#Assigning%20Privileges">define 
 privileges</a> (allowed functions) within each module of the Integrity 
 system. &#160;For 
 Rheology Data Analysis, this list of controllable functions includes most 
 of the menu items in the program. &#160;The 
 functions that are available to you depend on your assigned access group(s). 
 &#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Some features available in standard mode

 Session</span>: &#160;Each 
 action performed within Rheology Advantage data analysis is recorded in 
 an analysis log. &#160;When 
 a session is committed to a report the associated log is stored in the

 through the database viewer.</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="5"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Print

 session in the database.</li>

 to Disk</span>: &#160;Data

 so that it can be read by the non-Integrity version of the data analysis 
 software.</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="7"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Database 
 and Disk-Based Files in Same Session</span>: &#160;If 
 you have privileges set up to allow both secure and non-secure files to

 or printed, it will have text added to indicate it is from a non-secure 
 source.</li>
                <li class="Bullet" value="2">If the session is saved, 
 the file will be saved to the database. Text will be added to the name 
 to indicate that it was from a non-secure source and there will be an 
 import entry in the audit log.</li>
                <li class="Bullet" value="3">If a hard copy is produced 
 by performing a print and commit, the footer will include a note to indicate 
 that the report contains non-secure data.</li>
