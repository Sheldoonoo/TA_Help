        <h1>Calculated Signals</h1>
        <p>Calculated signals are signals that are available on the <a href="Win_Signal_Selection.htm">Signal Selection window</a>, but are not stored in the instrument data file. Calculated signals are computed "on-the-fly" when needed.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p>Some examples of calculated signals are TMA Sample Length, TGA Weight Change, DMA Dynamic Force, and DSC Kinetic Heat Flow.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p>In some cases, the ability to compute a calculated sigal depends on which signals were originally saved in the data file. If the required signals are not present in the data file then the calculated signal will not appear in the <span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Signal Selection</span> drop down list. For example, the TGA Weight signal must be stored in the data file in order to compute the calculated signal Weight Change.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p>When data files are exported, calculated signals are not included because they will be automatically regenerated when Universal Analysis reads the exported file. To force the inclusion of a calculated signal in an exported data file, you must first include the signal in the current plot and then select <a href="Menu_file_export_data_file_file_and_plot_signals.htm">Export Data File/File and Plot Signals</a>. The calculated signal will now appear in the list of available output signals.</p>
