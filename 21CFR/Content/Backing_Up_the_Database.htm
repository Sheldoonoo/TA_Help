 Up the Database</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>It is extremely important to regularly back up the information in the 
 Oracle® database (see <a href="Trademarks_and_Patents.htm">Trademarks 
 and Patents</a><a name="kanchor85"></a> for trademark information). &#160;Daily 
 backup to a reliable utility is recommended to best maintain the integrity 
 of the system and allow retrieval of data, if necessary. </p>
        <p>When looking to purchase a backup utility you may want to consider the 
 following minimum attributes: &#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet" value="1">Ability to backup a live 
 (active) database</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="2">Job scheduling capability</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="3">Record sorting functions</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="4">Administration from a computer 
 networked to the server (if desirable).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In many cases, the backup operation may start and/or restart the database. 
 Therefore we recommend scheduling your backup operation during times when 
 the database has the least amount of use. &#160;</p>
        <p>In addition to backing up the files to specified hard-disk drive folder, 
 the utility used for backup should include a method to transfer the backup 
 files to a longer-term media such as tape, CD-R, or DVD-R. </p>
        <p>There are many ways to backup and recover information contained in Oracle 
 databases. &#160;This 
 section provides information that you can use to determine the type of 
 system best suited for your needs.</p>

        <h3>Built-in Oracle® Facilities</h3>
        <p>Oracle's Enterprise Manager supplies a backup utility and associated 
 documentation that can be accessed through the Oracle 9i server CD-ROMs. 
 &#160;To access 
 this utility, Oracle Management Server (OMS) must be installed on at least 
 one of your Oracle servers. &#160;This 
 is installed from the Oracle 9i Server CD set. </p>
        <p>For more information on the Oracle backup utility, access the following 
 website: &#160;&#160;http://www.orafaq.com/faqdbabr.htm.</p>
        <p>In additon to the utility described above, a command-line based utility 
 is automatically installed on all Oracle servers in the %OraHome%\bin 
 folder named Ocopy.exe. &#160;The 
 syntax is similar to the standard copy command (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e</span>., 
 'copy x:\databasefiles.dbf &#160;y:\backupdir'). 
 &#160;This command 
 will copy active database files, but it will stop the database before 
 performing the backup. &#160;Refer 
 to your &#160;Oracle 
 documentation for further information.</p>

        <h3>Additional Backup Utilities</h3>
        <p>As an alternative to the built-in Oracle backup system, you may want 
 to consider one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet" value="1">The DDS/4 Tape drive option 
 offered by TA Instruments includes an evaluation version of Veritas Backup 
 Exec, which includes an Oracle agent. For more information, a fairly comprehensive 
 list of Oracle Backup Solutions Program partners (BSP) is available at 
 http://technet.oracle.com/deploy/availability/htdocs/bsp.htm.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet" value="1">There are several Graphical 
 User Interface (GUI)-based, basic functionality programs available. &#160;One 
 of the more widely used utilities is the DBBackup package available at 
 http://www.kiesoft.com/oraback. This utility features such the ability 
 to backup a live database, direct support for tape devices, support for 
 CD-R/RW &amp; DVD-R, etc. &#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Should you require more information than we have presented here regarding 
 backup utilities, please contact your TA Instruments representative at 
 the office nearest your location (see <a href="TA_Instruments_Offices.htm">TA 
 Instruments Offices</a> ).</p>
