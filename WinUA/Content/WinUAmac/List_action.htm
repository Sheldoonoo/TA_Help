        <h2>Action</h2>
        <p>Select the action that you want to be performed after your message dialog response has occurred from the following list:</p>
        <p class="footnote_text" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Continue macro execution</span>When you select this action, after the appropriate response has been selected, the macro will continue.</p>
        <p><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Stop macro, wait for run</span>When you select this action, after the appropriate response has been selected, the macro will stop and you must select Run from the Macro menu (or type Ctrl+R) to continue the macro.</p>
        <p><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Stop macro, wait for Accept Limits</span>When you select this action, after the appropriate response has been selected, the macro will stop and you must select the cursor limits on the curve and accept the limits. (In this case, the dialog replaces the standard <a href="../winhlp/Menu_popup_accept_limits.htm">Accept Limits</a> function that can be captured during an analysis.)</p>
        <p class="Normal_Indent"><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Stop macro, wait for next OK</span>When you select this action the macro will stop the running of the macro to wait for the operator to press the OK button on a window. Once the OK button has been pressed, the macro will continue.</p>
        <p><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Jump to macro start</span>When you select this action, after the appropriate response has been selected, the macro will jump to its first step and begin running again.</p>
        <p><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Jump to macro end</span>When you select this action, after the appropriate response has been selected, the macro will jump to its last step and end.</p>
        <p><span style="color: teal;font-weight: bold;">Jump to macro step</span>When you select this action, after the appropriate response has been selected, the macro will jump to a step number that you have entered in the <a href="Entry_macro_jump_step.htm">Jump Step field</a>.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Body_Text">NOTE: If the person responding to your macro dialog chooses the button that is opposite of the response you are asking for (the expected response is Yes and they choose No), the macro will keep on going and will not perform the action you requested for your dialog. If Cancel is chosen on the macro dialog, the macro will stop running at that point.</p>
