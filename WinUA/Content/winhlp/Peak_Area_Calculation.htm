        <h1>Peak Area Calculation</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 5.00pt;margin-bottom: 5.00pt;">In Universal Analysis the area of a peak is calculated as a running sum of trapezoidal area sections. The corner points of each trapezoid are defined by adjacent data points taken from the signal curve and the peak integration baseline. The parallel sides of each trapezoid are vertical, not perpendicular to the baseline (unless the baseline happens to be horizontal.) The first and last sections of the area sumation are defined by two area triangles. One corner of each triangle is defined by the intersection of the curve and an endpoint of the baseline. The other corners of the triangles correspond to the corners of the first and last trapezoidal sections.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5.00pt;margin-bottom: 5.00pt;">Integration is done with respect to time (even if temperature is plotted on the x-axis). The only exception to this rule is for integration of a DSC Heat Capacity signal, in which case the temperature signal is used for the integration x-axis.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5.00pt;margin-bottom: 5.00pt;">The limit points for a peak integration baseline are shown on the plot as tick-marks on the curve. The integration baseline is drawn between these points. The peak area calculation is performed over the entire range of the peak integration baseline. The calculation does not start or stop at the extrapolated onset or endset. This is true for all types of baselines (linear, extrapolated, and sigmoidal).</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5.00pt;margin-bottom: 5.00pt;">Placement of the peak integration start and stop (baseline) cursors is important. Cursor placement can affect the peak area when the peak onset and endset baselines are at different levels and/or slopes. A common mistake with severely sloping baselines is to place a start cursor too far back on the baseline portion of the curve so that the integration baseline actually passes above the onset portion of the curve. This causes a small amount of calculated area to be subtracted, instead of added, to the total peak area. Another common problem is arbitrary placement of the cursors when there is no clear return to baseline at the end of a peak, or when the slope of the onset baseline is significantly different from the slope of the endset baseline.</p>
