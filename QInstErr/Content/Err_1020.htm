        <h4><a name="kanchor680"></a>The system detected a problem controlling humidity. Run continuing.</h4>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Problem:</span> &#160;</p>
        <p>The relative humidity (RH) is controlled by a pair of very precise mass 
 flow controllers (MFCs). Sensors located near the sample and reference 
 provide ongoing verification that the relative humidity achieved is what 
 was requested. The relative humidity range of the chamber can be controlled 
 from 0 to 98 %RH and the system has detected a problem controlling the 
 humidity level during the experiment. </p>
        <p>The experiment will not be stopped. The run will continue to the end 
 and data will be saved, but you will need to confirm its accuracy or run 
 the test again.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Solution:</p>
        <p>Verify the relative humidity being reported by the Q5000 SA instrument 
 using the <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Humidity Verification</span> 
 procedures accessed through the <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Platinum</span> 
 functions. This verification is based on the deliquescence of readily 
 available, well understood materials evaluated in a ramped humidity experiment. 
 Verification of the relative humidity is usually based on measurements 
 at 25Â°C. However, verification can be performed at other temperatures 
 using suitable standards and procedures. </p>
        <p>For more details refer to the Q5000 online help.</p>
        <p>If the humidity verification fails, contact TA Instruments for service.</p>
