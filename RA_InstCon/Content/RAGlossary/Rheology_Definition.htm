        <h1><a name="kanchor1106"></a>What is Rheology?</h1>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="kanchor1107"></a><a name="kanchor1108"></a>Newton (c.1700) was the first to formulate 
 a mathematical description of the resistance of a fluid to deform or flow 
 when a stress was applied to it. He described this resistance as the <span style="font-style: italic;"><a name="kanchor1109"></a>viscosity. </span><a name="kanchor1110"></a><a name="kanchor1111"></a>From that time until Couette 
 developed the first rotational viscometer (c.1890), viscosity was measured 
 using stress driven (gravity) flow. Many techniques that use this principle, 
 such as flow cups, U-tubes, capillaries, etc. are still very popular.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="kanchor1112"></a>The term ‘Rheology’ was suggested by Professor 
 Bingham of Lafayette College, Easton PA. This definition was officially 
 accepted when the American Society of Rheology was founded in 1929.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Rheology can be defined as </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p class="Tip-Note-Text" style="font-style: italic;font-weight: normal;"><a name="kanchor1113"></a>" The science 
 of the deformation and flow of matter."</p>
        <p class="Tip-Note-Text" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Rheology plays a part in everyday life 
 in some form or another. For instance, why does the water run out of a 
 bath when the plug is removed? How does the manufacturer ensure that toothpaste 
 can be squeezed from a tube yet can retain its shape without slumping 
 through the bristles of a toothbrush? Can you imagine how painful it would 
 be if you blinked and there was no fluid in your eye? These and many more 
 examples show how every one is affected by rheology.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;font-weight: normal;">&#160;</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">To this end, it can be assumed that any 
 action or process that involves fluids or semi-solids can be regarded 
 as being rheological.</p>
