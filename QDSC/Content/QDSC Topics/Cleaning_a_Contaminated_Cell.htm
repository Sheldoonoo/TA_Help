        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Baseline anomalies are often the sign of a 
 contaminated cell. DSC and PDSC cells must be cleaned properly to maintain 
 satisfactory operation. Scraping the contamination off is not recommended.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If your baseline appears to show sample contamination, 
 try the following recommended cleaning procedure. The procedure varies 
 slightly depending upon the type of cell (QDSC Standard Cell or QDSC Pressure 
 Cell) and the type of cooler that is installed. </p>

        <ul>
            <li value="1">Determine that the anomalies 
 seen in the baseline are actually caused by contamination, and not a faulty 
 Tzero™ calibration. Contamination is normally manifested in very sharp, 
 distinct, and sometimes noisy peaks in an empty baseline (no pans) run. 
 If the baseline run shows shifts or step changes in the baseline, large 
 startup events, or slope, these are more likely caused by a faulty Tzero 
 calibration and no amount of cleaning will correct the problem. </li>
            <li value="2">If you have determined that 
 the anomalies in the baseline are in fact caused by contamination, select 
 a solvent that is most appropriate for dissolving the contaminant. Note 
 that in most cases an organic solvent such as acetone or methanol may 
 be necessary, but an aqueous solvent might also work for some contaminates.</li>
            <li value="3">Dampen the end of a small 
 cotton swab with the chosen solvent. Avoid saturating the swab to prevent 
 the solvent from dripping into the Tzero thermocouple tube. </li>
            <li value="4">Gently dissolve the contaminants 
 with the swab, starting at the outside of the silver housing within the 
 sample chamber and working inwards toward the Tzero thermocouple. Repeat 
 the process until the contaminants have been removed. Do not rub hard 
 with the swab, especially at the Tzero thermocouple.</li>
            <li value="5">Dry the interior of the cell 
 with a clean dry swab. </li>
            <li value="6">Heat the cell to 200˚C 
 in Nitrogen at approximately 50 ml/min, and hold for 5 minutes to remove 
 all traces of solvent. </li>
            <li value="7">Verify by running an empty 
 baseline run. Always store all available Diagnostic Signals when running 
 verification baseline runs. If the anomalies are gone, but the baseline 
 shape or slope is not acceptable, then Tzero calibration may be necessary. 
 If the anomalies are still there, but are less evident, repeat the above 
 steps and re-verify the baseline. </li>
            <li value="8">If you are unable to remove 
 the anomalies using the above procedure, then you will need to perform 
 additional cell cleaning by heating the cell to a high temperature in 
 an oxidizing atmosphere. This procedure should only be done as a last 
 resort. </li>
            <li value="9">Begin by connecting the air 
 purge. &#160;<span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">See 
 also:</span> &#160;<a href="Connecting_Purge_Gas_Lines.htm">Connecting 
 Purge Gas Lines</a>, and then follow the steps below depending on which 
 cooler is installed. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Notes">NOTE: &#160;Cleaning 
 of the cell is performed with the lids off to prevent the lid gas exit 
 tube from becoming plugged by condensing off-gases. &#160;If 
 your instrument is equipped with an Autolid mechanism you will need to 
 open the cell manually at the start of the method. &#160;You 
 can open the cell by selecting <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Lid</span>

        <p class="Notes">NOTE: &#160;When 
 removing the RCS/LNCS heat exchanger from the cell, it is recommended 
 that the RCS or LNCS be allowed to warm to room temperature after turning 
 it "off" before removing the heat exchanger. &#160;That

 avoid the possibility of damaging the connector hose by moving while cold

        <h3><a name="Cleaning a Contaminated Pressure Cell"></a>Cleaning a Contaminated 
 QDSC Pressure Cell</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A poor baseline is often the sign of a contaminated 
 cell. PDSC cells must be cleaned properly to maintain satisfactory operation. 
 Scraping the contamination off the cell's constantan disc is not recommended 
 because the disc is very thin (about 0.1 mm, or 0.004 inches), and if 
 the disc deforms, the baseline may be affected. &#160;</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">If your baseline appears to show sample contamination, 
 try the following recommended cleaning procedure:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="1">Remove any 
 pans from the cell. </li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="2">Connect the

            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="3">Lightly brush 
 out the cell with a small fiberglass eraser (included in the DSC accessory 
 kit).</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="4">Clean the 
 disk with air.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Notes">NOTE: &#160;Be 
 sure to wear safety glasses or goggles when cleaning the cell with air.</p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="5">Begin cleaning 
 by heating the cell with an air purge to 50 °C above the highest operating 
 temperature or 600 °C, whichever is lower. Use a heating rate of 20 °C/min. 
 Ramp to 600 °C, then hold isothermally for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="6">After the 
 cell has cooled down, repeat steps 3 and 4.</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="7">Run the experiment 
 again and compare the baselines. If there is a marked improvement but 
 the baseline is still unacceptable, the contaminant probably oxidized 
 and reduced to an inert ash. Run the experiment again and check for further 
 improvement. &#160;</li>
            <li class="NumberedIndent" value="8">Once the 
 baseline is acceptable, return to normal operation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the constantan disc looks clean and is not bent or cracked, but the 
 baseline problem remains, it is probably not due to contamination; the 
 cell may need to be replaced (contact your TA Instruments service representative).</p>
