        <h4><a name="kanchor515"></a>Heat flow results using this pan type are not optimized.</h4>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Problem:</p>
        <p>The type of pan you have selected is not the best for the heat flow 
 type.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Solution:</p>
        <p>Choose the optimum type of sample pan for use with the heat flow type 
 chosen. See the following for more information.</p>
        <h3>Pan Resistance Correction (Q1000 Only)</h3>
        <p>The DSC Q1000 provides a more accurate measurement of true sample heat 
 flow by accounting for heat flow within the DSC cell sensor as well as 
 between the sensor and the sample pan. The resultant sample heat flow 
 is designated as T4P heat flow.</p>
        <p>The heat flow between the sensor and sample pan is primarily affected 
 by the sample pan thermal resistance, which, in turn, is a function of 
 the pan material (thermal conductivity) and temperature, assuming that 
 both the pan and sensor are perfectly flat surfaces and in intimate contact. 
 This assumption, however, is not true, even if careful experimental procedure 
 is followed when preparing samples. Therefore, the thermal resistance 
 of the thin layer of purge gas between the pan and sensor must also be 
 considered.</p>
        <p>TA Instruments has included in the Q Series Thermal Advantage software 
 fixed values for both pan and purge gas thermal resistances. Supported 
 pan choices include aluminum, hermetic aluminum, gold, and hermetic gold. 
 Purge gas choices include air, nitrogen, oxygen, and helium. &#160;When 
 running experiments where T4P heat flow is being measured, select the 
 pan type and purge gas that will be used. </p>
