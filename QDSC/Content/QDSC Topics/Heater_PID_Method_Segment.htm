        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Heater PID</span> 
 method segment is used to change the performance of the instrument furnace 
 during the execution of a thermal method. PID stands for Proportional, 
 Integral, and Derivative, the three modes of traditional temperature control. 
 The Heater PID segment specifies the control coefficients for each mode 
 of temperature control. </p>
        <p>The instrument furnace is run by a control system that uses factory 
 default PID coefficients. The default coefficients are automatically set 
 and adjusted to give excellent furnace performance under various operating 
 conditions. However, sometimes it may be useful to further optimize furnace 
 performance for all or part of a specific method.</p>
        <p>The Heater PID method segment provides the ability to change control 
 coefficients while a thermal method is running. &#160;Every 
 time the instrument is reset or a method ends, the three PID coefficients 
 are reset to their factory default settings. When a Heater PID segment 
 is encountered in a running method, the current PID furnace control coefficients 
 are immediately replaced with new coefficients from the Heater PID method 
 segment. The new coefficients are used to control the furnace for the 
 remainder of the method, or until another Heater PID method segment is 
 encountered.</p>
        <p>Determining what PID coefficients to use requires some trial and error 
 experimentation on the part of the user. A general description of each 
 control mode and advice for determining useful parameters is provided 
 below.</p>

        <h3><a name="Proportional control"></a>Proportional Control</h3>
        <p>Proportional control mode provides furnace power in direct proportion 
 to the difference (error) between the measured furnace temperature and 
 the desired furnace temperature. When the error is zero the applied power 
 is zero. As the error increases the applied power to the furnace is increased 
 in proportion to the error until a maximum permitted power is reached. 
 Beyond this maximum power point, and at zero power, the furnace is said 
 to be “out of control.” The temperature error range between the application 
 of zero power and maximum power is called the proportional band or “prop 
 band.”</p>
        <p>The PID Proportional coefficient (W/°C) determines the width of the 
 proportional band. &#160;A 
 coefficient of 1.0 delivers one watt of power for every °C of temperature 
 error. The maximum power available varies depending on the furnace type 
 in use.</p>
        <p>Since some furnace power is required to maintain a furnace at an elevated 
 temperature (unless there is no heat loss to the surroundings), there 
 will always be a small temperature error that cannot be removed using 
 only the proportional mode of control. This error is called “droop” or 
 “offset.” The integral control mode is used to remove this type of error.</p>

        </p>
        <h3><a name="Integral control"></a>Integral Control</h3>
        <p>Integral control mode provides extra furnace power to compensate for 
 any long-term difference between measured furnace temperature and desired 
 furnace temperature. The amount of temperature error is measured (integrated) 
 over time to determine the average error. A power correction based on 
 this average error is then applied to the furnace. &#160;This 
 type of correction is also called “reset.”</p>
        <p>The PID Integral coefficient (W/°C-sec) determines how rapidly the offset 
 error is corrected. A coefficient of 1.0 delivers one watt of additional 
 furnace power for every °C-sec of integrated temperature error.</p>

        </p>
        <h3><a name="Derivative control"></a>Derivative Control</h3>
        <p>Derivative control mode is an anticipatory control function that measures 
 the rate of change of the furnace temperature and reduces the furnace 
 power to avoid temperature overshoot. A negative power correction is applied 
 to the furnace based on the rate of change (°C/sec) of the measured temperature. 
 This type of correction is also called “rate”.</p>
        <p>The PID Derivative coefficient (W/°C/sec) determines how much breaking 
 action to apply. A coefficient of 1.0 delivers minus one watt of power 
 for every °C/sec of measured heating rate. </p>

        <h3><a name="Determining PID Coefficients"></a>Determining PID Coefficients</h3>
        <p>No one set of PID coefficients will produce optimal results under all 
 conditions. &#160;A 
 certain amount of experimentation is required to determine the best coefficients 
 for a particular set of conditions. &#160;Tradeoffs 
 must be made between different aspects of furnace performance (e.g., rapid 
 furnace response time versus larger temperature overshoot).</p>
        <p>The conventional PID coefficient tuning process involves making individual 
 runs using empty sample containers. &#160;Each 
 run performs the method of interest, or just the critical portion of the 
 method of interest, such as a temperature ramp to isothermal hold, or 
 an equilibration at elevated temperature. &#160;A 
 Heater PID method segment is inserted as the first step of the test method, 
 or at the critical point in the test method, so that experimental PID 
 coefficients can be tried and the effect on furnace performance noted.</p>
        <p>The first step in the complete PID tuning process involves making a 
 quick estimate of a set of stable PID coefficients. &#160;This 
 is accomplished by adjusting each coefficient in turn and observing the 
 result of the adjustment on temperature and heating rate. &#160;Then 
 further refinement of each coefficient is made to increase or decrease 
 the characteristic effect of that coefficient on the furnace control.</p>

        <h3><a name="Adjusting the proportional coefficient"></a>Adjusting the 
 Proportional Coefficient</h3>
        <p>The Proportional coefficient is adjusted first. &#160;The 
 Integral and Derivative coefficients are set to zero during this test. 
 &#160;The Proportional 
 coefficient is first set to any nominal value (one tenth of the maximum 
 furnace power is suggested). &#160;The 
 test method is run with the Heater PID method segment inserted. &#160;Sample 
 temperature and heating rate are plotted versus time.</p>
        <p>If the result of the test is stable (no sustained oscillations in temperature) 
 then increase the Proportional coefficient and repeat the test until a 
 value of the Proportional coefficient is found that is just large enough 
 to produce sustained oscillations in temperature around the temperature 
 set point. &#160;Select 
 one half of this value for the Proportional coefficient. &#160;</p>
        <p>Alternately, the Proportional coefficient can be determined by increasing/decreasing 
 the coefficient until the peak height of each temperature oscillation 
 is approximately one quarter that of the peak height of the previous oscillation. 
 &#160;Select 
 this value for the Proportional coefficient.</p>

        </p>
        <h3><a name="Adjusting the integral coefficient"></a>Adjusting the Integral 
 Coefficient</h3>
        <p>The Integral coefficient is adjusted next. The Proportional coefficient 
 is set to the value determined by the previous testing. The Integral coefficient 
 is set to any nominal value (twice the Proportional coefficient is suggested 
 as a start). &#160;The 
 Derivative coefficient is set to zero. The same series of test runs are 
 made as when adjusting the Proportional coefficient. The temperature and 
 heating rate are observed. Increase the Integral coefficient until a sustained 
 oscillation is achieved as in the proportional testing. Select one third 
 of this value for the Integral coefficient.</p>
        <p>Alternately, the Integral coefficient can be determined by increasing/decreasing 
 the Integral coefficient until the amount of observed temperature offset 
 is acceptable. Select this value for the Integral coefficient.</p>

        </p>
        <h3><a name="Adjusting the derivative coefficient"></a>Adjusting the Derivative 
 Coefficient</h3>
        <p>The Derivative coefficient is adjusted last. &#160;The 
 Proportional and Integral coefficients are set to the values previously 
 determined. The derivative coefficient is set to any nominal value (two 
 percent of the Proportional coefficient is suggested as a start). The 
 same series of test runs are made as when adjusting the Proportional and 
 Integral coefficients. The temperature and heating rate are observed. 
 Increase the Derivative coefficient until the temperature overshoot is 
 acceptable without unduly compromising the maximum heating rate required. 
 Select this value for the Integral coefficient.</p>

        <h3><a name="Final coefficient adjustment"></a>Final Coefficient Adjustment</h3>
        <p>If desired, the PID coefficients can be further adjusted to improve 
 furnace control by adjusting one coefficient at a time and observing the 
 effect on furnace control. The following guidelines can be used to help 
 with this adjustment:</p>
        <p>It is usually best to make final adjustments to the Derivative coefficient 
 first, then the Proportional coefficient, and finally the Integral coefficient. 
 </p>
        <p>The Proportional coefficient controls the amount of power applied for 
 each degree of temperature error, and the Integral coefficient controls 
 the amount of power applied to correct for temperature offset. Larger 
 values for each of these coefficients will increase the temperature overshoot 
 and the amount of temperature oscillation, but will reduce the time needed 
 to reach a set point temperature and the amount of temperature offset. 
 &#160;Smaller 
 values will have the opposite effect.</p>
        <p>The Derivative coefficient controls the amount of temperature overshoot 
 and the maximum heating rate obtainable when approaching a temperature 
 set point. Larger values of the coefficient will reduce the temperature 
 overshoot and reduce the maximum heating rate. Smaller values will have 
 the opposite effect.</p>
