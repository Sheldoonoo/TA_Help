        <p style="color: #000000;font-weight: normal;">TA Instruments Rheology 
 Navigator 2 software allows you to carry out many functions and experiments, 
 without the need for operator intervention. This means that you can automatically 
 perform many routine experiments and repeat runs.</p>
        <p style="color: #000000;font-weight: normal;">Entire experiments, from 
 setting the rheometer up to analyzing data, can be carried out uninterrupted. 
 Carrying out a range of consecutive experiments, using different operational 
 modes (e.g., Flow, Creep, Oscillation), can also be effectively achieved.</p>
        <p style="color: #000000;font-weight: normal;">Each Rheology Navigator 
 2 program, or "script," is constructed using the script editor 
 to select from the various commands. Navigator supports <a href="Variables.htm" style="font-weight: normal;color: #0000ff;">variables</a> 
 (in the form of strings and numeric values) and also has a comprehensive 
 range of commands for <a href="Using_Conditional_Statements.htm" style="font-weight: normal;color: #0000ff;">conditional 
 branching</a> and program flow control.</p>
