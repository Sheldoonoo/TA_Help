        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once an instrument has been set up with an Advantage Integrity license, 
 it will become part of the Advantage Integrity system. &#160;Access 
 will be controlled, data will be stored in the Oracle database, and an 
 audit trail will record events. Once you are logged in to the instrument, 
 the basic operation of an Integrity instrument is the same as its non-Integrity 
 (standard) counterpart for calibrating, setting up experiments, and starting 
 runs. &#160;</p>
        <p>The few differences are noted here. &#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">SUID#</span>: 
 &#160;&#160;Instead 
 of defining the data storage path, the database will automatically assign 
 a SUID# to the original, raw data record. &#160;This 
 number can be seen on the <a href="Experimental_View_Pane_Summary_Page.htm">Summary 
 Page</a> of the Experimental View.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="Notes">NOTE: &#160;Each 
 saved data record within the database will also be assigned a Record ID 
 #, which is displayed on any saved images that are created. </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Project 
 Name</span>: &#160;Each 
 experiment is assigned to a Project. &#160;Project 
 assignment provides a means to category the data in the database, and 
 then later uses that assignment to sort the records in the database for 
 easier retrieval. &#160;The 
 available projects are those assigned to you by the TA System Manager. 
 &#160;The TA 
 System Manager is also responsible for defining the projects available 
 in this system. &#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">To assign a project to a run follow these 
 steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <ol>
                <li class="NumberedIndent" value="1">Click 
 on the <img src="../QDSC Images/ButtonICSelectProject.gif" style="border: none;width: 27px;height: 28px;float: none;border-style: none;border-style: none;" width="27" height="28" border="0" /> button to the right of the <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Project 
 Name</span> field.</li>
                <li class="NumberedIndent" value="2">Select 
 a project from those displayed and click OK.</li>
            </ol>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Operator</span>: 
 &#160;The Operator 
 field on the <a href="Experimental_View_Pane_Notes_Page.htm">Notes Page</a> 
 will automatically display the User ID of the person creating the run 
 and can not be changed. &#160;See 
 the section "<a href="#Handling%20Multiple%20Users%20for%20a%20Single%20Instrument">Handling 
 Multiple Users for a Single Instrument</a>" for rules that apply 
 when there is more then one user.</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="3"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;"><a name="Restricted or Unavailable Functions"></a>Restricted or Unavailable 
 Functions</span>: &#160;Within 
 the Advantage Integrity system the TA System Manager can define privileges 
 (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., restrict actions) within 
 each module of the system. &#160;</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Within the Q Series™ 
 instrument control program this list of controllable privileges includes 
 items such as access to calibration parameters and analysis, modifying 
 a running method, etc. &#160;Therefore, 
 typical functions may not be available depending on the access groups(s) 
 assigned to you. &#160;Consult 
 with your TA System Manager to learn about your privilege list for instrument 
 control. &#160;</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">In addition, a set of functions that are 
 available in the standard version of instrument control, are not available 
 when logged into the Integrity system. &#160;These 
 functions include: </p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li value="1">Run Reject</li>
                <li value="2">Network Drive </li>
                <li value="3">Autoanalysis.<br /><br /></li>
            </ul>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Method, 
 Procedures and Sequence Files</span>: &#160;These 
 files are not saved in the database, nor are the changes audited for these 
 files in this system. &#160;They 
 continue to be saved at the designated file location specified by the 
 operator. &#160;However, 
 file open and save for these file types are recorded in the audit trail. 
 &#160;Moreover, 
 the saved data record contains the details of the experimental conditions 
 (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>., method, calibration, and 
 instrument parameters) within the parameter block of the saved data record. 
 &#160;This information 
 can be viewed in the Universal Analysis program by selecting View/Parameter 
 Block. </li>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="3"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Active 
 Experiment</span>s: &#160;An 
 experiment which is currently in progress may be viewed in Universal Analysis, 
 but until the experiment is complete you can not save any results (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>, saved analyses, pdf generation).</li>

        <h3><a name="Handling Multiple Users for a Single Instrument"></a>Handling 
 Multiple Users for a Single Instrument</h3>
        <p>When there is more than one user accessing a single instrument, the 
 following rules apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="1">You can alter another user's 
 run only when assigned access rights to the project associated with that 
 run. &#160;You 
 will receive a message asking if you wish to "take ownership" 
 of that run. &#160;Select 
 Yes to take ownership. Your name will now be assigned as the Operator 
 on the <a href="Experimental_View_Pane_Notes_Page.htm">Notes Page</a>. 
 &#160;Select 
 No to deny ownership of that run, then you can click the <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Append</span> 
 button to create a new run.</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="2">You can still start another 
 user's run, even if you do not have access rights to the project assigned 
 to that run. &#160;In 
 this case, your User ID will be recorded as the Run Operator in the data 
 record's parameter block, which can be viewed through the Universal Analysis 
 program's View/Parameter Block function. &#160;The 
 operator name will remain as the User ID of the original owner.</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="3">You may delete any runs regardless 
 of their assigned projects.</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="4">If you do not have access 
 rights to the assigned run's project, you will get an Access Not Allowed 
 message. In this case, you will need to select the <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #00509f;">Append</span> 
 button to create a new run.</li>
            <li style="margin-top: 8px;" value="5">When you load a saved sequence, 
 the user currently performing this action is assigned as the operator 
 for all runs. &#160;If 
 any run in the saved sequence specifies a project that the current user 
 does not have the right to access, then that run's project is marked Unassigned. 
 &#160;Unassigned 
 projects must be changed to a valid project before the start of that run.</li>
        </ul>
