        <h1>Smoothing Calculation</h1>
        <p>In Universal Analysis the smoothed value of a signal is computed by evaluating a point on a fitted line at each data point along the curve. The fit is made using the method of least squares. The region over which the fit is made is a window of data points equal to the width of the signal-smoothing window (See <a href="Menu_tools_smooth.htm">Tools/Smooth</a>).</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p>For example, if one data point is taken each second and the smoothing window is 0.2 minutes (12 seconds), then the curve fit window is 12 data points wide. The smoothed value for each curve point is computed by fitting the 12 data points of the window to a straight line and then evaluating the y-value of the line at the central data point of the window. The window is then moved along the curve by one data point and the process is repeated until a fit and point-on-line evaluation has been made at every data point along the curve. At the ends of the curve, and at any breaks in the data, the point-on-line evaluations will be skewed away from the center of the window.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p>Universal Analysis permits the user to set/inspect the smoothing window using the Tools/Smooth function. Increasing the size of the window will decrease the noise in the smoothed signal, but may also reduce the resolution of the result. A minimum window of five data points is used to compute the smoothed value at each point, even if the x-axis window is set so small that fewer than five data points would actually fall within the window. In this case the window is automatically expanded during the smoothing calculation to include at least five points.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0;">&#160;</p>
        <p>The default smoothing window for normal data is zero <span style="font-style: italic;">(i.e.,</span> no smoothing is applied).</p>
