        <h4>The instrument audit log is approximately 80% full. &#160;Please 
 ensure that the controller is connected and receiving audit log data.</h4>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Problem:</p>
        <p>The audit log buffer in the instrument is almost full. &#160;The 
 controller has stopped transferring messages to the database.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Solution:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="Bullet" value="1">If the error occurred while 
 the instrument was off line from a controller, and it has been awhile 
 since the controller was last connected, try connecting the controller 
 to an instrument. This may transfer the contents of the log buffer and 
 resolve the issue. &#160;</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="2">This could also be an indication 
 that the controller has lost it's connection to the Integrity database 
 server. &#160;Ensure 
 the connection and that the server is in working order. &#160;</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="3">If these suggestions fail 
 to fix the problem, and you have not already done so, try closing down 
 and reopening the controller software. &#160;</li>
            <li class="Bullet" value="4">If the problem persists after 
 trying the steps above, contact TA Instruments for service. </li>
        </ul>
