        <p>The SDT measures the heat flow and weight changes associated with transitions and reactions in materials over the temperature range ambient to 1500°C. &#160;The information provided differentiates endothermic and exothermic events which have no associated weight change (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>. melting and crystallization) from those which involve a weight change (<span style="font-style: italic;">e.g</span>. degradation). &#160;Furthermore, performing both DSC and TGA measurements at the same time, on the same instrument and same sample, offers greater productivity and removes experimental and sampling variables as factors in the analysis of data.</p>
        <p class="Bullet">There are four available <a href="Selecting_an_SDT_Operating_Mode.htm">modes</a> that can be used when running experiments on the SDT—standard, calibration, dual sample, and dual sample calibration. The mode is selected on the <a href="Experimental_View_PaneSummary.htm">Experiment View/Summary Page</a>.</p>

        <h4>Sample and Reference Balance Assemblies</h4>
        <p>The sample and reference balance assemblies consist of the individual meter movements, balance beams (including sample platform, platinum liners, and thermocouple wires), tare beams and tare weights, position sensor beams, and sensors, all fastened to a meter mount. Both meter mounts are, in turn, fastened to a y-axis adjustable platform. See the figure below.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Because the sample and reference balance assemblies are identical, but mirror images of each other, the following description applies to both assemblies (refer to the figure above for an illustration of these parts):</p>

        <h4>Furnace</h4>
        <p>The SDT furnace consists of a furnace tube, a furnace can, an air-cooling apparatus, and a metal bellows, all of which are mounted to a cradle that moves the furnace to an open (left) or closed (right) position.</p>

        <h3><a name="SDT Theory of Operation"></a>SDT Theory of Operation</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Simultaneous DSC-TGA instrument combines two thermal analysis techniques: &#160;(1) measuring the amount and rate of change in sample mass as a function of temperature and time—thermogravimetric analysis, or TGA—and (2) measuring the heat flow differences (enthalpic changes) as a sample is uniformly heated as a function of temperature and time—differential scanning calorimetry, or DSC.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;font-size: 8pt;"><a href="#top" style="font-size: 8pt;">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <h4>TGA Functions</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The TGA-functioning portion of the instrument operates on a null balance principle. Physically attached to a taut-band meter movement, the balance arm is maintained in a horizontal reference position by an optically actuated servo loop. When the balance is in a null position, a position sensor flag blocks an equal amount of light to each of the photodiodes (the light is supplied by a constant current infrared LED). As sample weight is lost or gained, the beam becomes unbalanced, causing an unequal amount of light to strike the photodiodes. The unbalanced signal, called the error signal, is acted upon by the control circuitry and reduced to zero, or nulled. This is accomplished by an increase or decrease in the current to the meter movement, causing it to rotate back to its original position (null position). The change in current necessary to accomplish this task is directly proportional to the change in mass of the sample. This current is converted to the weight signal.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The TGA analysis is used to characterize any material that exhibits weight loss or phase changes as a result of decomposition, dehydration, and oxidation. Two modes are commonly used for investigating thermal stability behavior in controlled atmospheres: (1) dynamic, in which the temperature is increased at a linear rate, and (2) isothermal, in which the temperature is kept constant.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;font-size: 8pt;"><a href="#top" style="font-size: 8pt;">Back to top</a>
        </p>
        <h4>DSC Functions</h4>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The SDT accomplishes DSC measurements, along with TGA measurements, by employing a single heat source and two symmetrically located and identical sample platforms at the end of two parallel beams. &#160;Thermocouples, welded at the center of the sample platforms, measure the differential heat flow to the sample and reference as both are heated at a uniform rate by the furnace. &#160;Sample temperature is also monitored directly by the thermocouple in the sample platform. &#160;With proper calibration, the heat flow associated with endothermic and exothermic transitions in materials can be measured to a high degree of accuracy and precision (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">+</span> 2%). Without calibration, the heat flow results obtained are qualitative (DTA).</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">During normal operation of the SDT, the sample or reference may evolve gases as heat is applied. To prevent back-diffusion of these liberated gases to the balance housing, the balance housing is purged with an inert gas regulated by the flowmeter. An inert gas must be used to prevent contamination or corrosion of the balance.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The DSC portion of the analysis works on the principle that when a sample and an inert reference are heated at a known rate in a controlled environment, the increase in the sample and reference temperature will be the same unless a heat-related change takes place in the sample. If this change takes place, the sample temperature either leads or lags the reference temperature (<span style="font-style: italic;">i.e.</span>, the sample either evolves or absorbs heat). &#160;With a well defined heat flow, the (<span style="font-family: Symbol, serif;">D</span>T) which develops can be converted to heat flow using the thermal equivalent of Ohm’s Law. &#160;This is the same “heat flux” approach widely used in most stand-alone DSC’s.</p>
